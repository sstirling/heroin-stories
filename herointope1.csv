Christian,48,Male,Toms River,Ocean,"I was introduced to heroin when I was 42. I am 48 now and in recovery with no relapses for 2 years. During the 4 years I used heroin (other opiates when heroin wasn't obtainable) I lived a horrific nightmare which I wouldn't wish upon anyone. The grips of opioid addiction were unyielding, taking from me everything but my last breath. I would have done anything for that next fix and the things I did do if listed here would mirror parts of every story ever told by an addict.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Anon.,33,Female,East Brunswick,Middlesex,"It started with back pain and a trip to the Pain Mgt specialist. My husband was prescribed a somewhat low dose of painkillers. Upon discovering some herniated discs with no option for surgery his doctor kept him on a management system for painkillers. Over the course of 5 years his prescription nearly tripled in dose and quantity. He began a downward spiral. I began hiding pills, counting pills...his addiction became my addiction. He would run out of his prescription 2 weeks in advance and I would find him buying them off the street. He would lie to me all the time. While he never exactly moved on to heroin this addiction was just as bad. He became a person I didn't know. I was living with a stranger. His every thought was consumed by how many pills he had left, when he would take his next pill, how we would obtain more once he was out of his legal prescription. Addiction has broken our family. It will always play a part in our lives even when he is clean. There will always be a fear inside that he will return to being the monster he was while on oxycodone. I thought by doing it the legal way things would be ok. Unfortunately I didn't realize how easily obtainable these prescriptions were and how his doctor wouldn't question his use but just keep prescribing more and more pills to keep him in business. It's extremely sad.",quote,His addiction became my addiction,Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,
Kate,25,Female,Franklin Park,Somerset,"it began with roxicontin. we were working at a chain restaurant together, often closing or working all day long. the shifts were long and hard to get through but the cash was nice. a fellow co-worker offered us roxicontin pills for $25 each, so we each bought one to try after our horrible shifts. I puked, my best friend got hooked. from that one disgusting little blue pill, her problem snowballed quickly and dangerously. I would go along (like an idiot) because I love my friend and I just didn't see the signs fast enough. one pill a day became two, then three, then four or more. my friend (and her scumbag then-boyfriend) quickly ran through all of her sweet waitressing money and began to steal from her mother. she would borrow her debit card and pull out $50-$100 at a clip. When her mother ran out of money she became suspicious, and my friend had to hide her problem. she would borrow money from me for ""gas"" or ""food"" and spend it all on pills. when the pills ran out (I think her source got arrested), some other addicts offered her heroin. she was able to ""manage"" her heroin problem for about two months, until her brother found the wax paper folds and a cut up straw in her wallet. once her family found out, my friend was sent to rehab. I supported her (and still do) the best I could without enabling her by giving her money when she got out, and she was clean for a little while. but soon enough the monster of heroin addiction was after her again. She got fired from her job, was kicked out of her house, and was living in her boyfriend's car. I took my tips from a busy friday night at the restaurant and bought her a gift card to be used at a hotel and some bread and peanut butter. after that I didn't see her for a while, and she went back into rehab. after leaving the scumbag ex-boyfriend, she almost has her life back. I just hope that the demon of heroin addiction can be managed. I am scared for her life on a daily basis. I wish we said no to that disgusting, horrible little blue pill. Please, help us manage prescription drug abuse and monitor your kids. It could save their lives.",box,,Friend,Friend,friend.svg,,

Chris,45,Female,Runnemede,Camden,"My niece is 24 yrs old addicted to herion. Currently in rehab for her first time, I'm sure not last. She suffered some personal tragedy at the age of 11 & started stealing her mother's pills at the age of 12. Over the yrs it progressed , she managed to hide it well. She gave birth to a baby at the age of 18, claimed she was sober throughout her pregnancy but we'll never know for sure. He was born ""premature"" looked sickly his first wk but wound up being a very healthy & active lil boy. My niece, her siblings and son were all in my custody at one point. I'm telling the story looking in the window. I saw lies, disappointment, anger, frustration & a lil boy ripped away from the ones who loved him. The lil boy's mother & father are addicts. His family members were not approved to take him so he stayed with our family & one of his Aunts who decided to live with us. We had the 2 of them for 4 yrs. There was so much family drama for this lil boy I asked extended family members to take him in & they gladly did so. I thought they would be the perfect mediator between two conflicting families. Turns out I was wrong, this lil boy was not taken care of in the same manner he was in our custody & he was taken out of the home for none of us to see him again. He's still in custody, parental rights terminated & all ties have been severed with his past. I miss him terribly!! He's now 5, I haven't seen him in 8 months, his mother still in rehab & Again probably not her last time. Not just one family has been torn apart but many. Ours, His, & now another family (those who have custody at present time) It's not easy being a family member and not have any control. If my niece would have had the proper support from day 1 (when she was 11) maybe things would have worked out differently? I blame the addict for not having the strength to say NO, I blame the courts, local CPS for not following up on a traumatized lil girl. It's a vicious cycle in this family tree. So far the only one who came out beating the odds was the child who stayed with us till she was an adult. She managed to survive but it too is painful for her to hear her sister say, ""She just wants to forget bout her son."" This is our First Christmas without him!! Not knowing if he's ok is just killing me, I want to know if he's being loved & not just being used for his monthly state allowance! We truly loved this boy & his family, I chose to let him go & give him the chance to be an honorable man. There was so many vicious attacks on the kids from their own family everytime I have my doubts I remind myself there was no other way. I couldn't risk losing my own children//grandchildren due to Petty Drama! The family was furious he was doing well in our environment & constantly hassled our family (even those not directly involved). It was an all round bad situation for so many. Herion is not just a drug addiction!! It ruins lives, breaks hearts, severs ties, creates limits, shatters trust...It's destroys so many. I know now long term rehab is such a huge part of recovery but there is a saying, You can lead a horse to water but can't make em drink it!! And it's SO TRUE!! Yes rehabs are important but sometimes so is prison. Know the difference between the rehabilitation & recovery. Now that my niece has zero responsibilities other then to herself there's nothing stopping her from robbing, stealing, overdosing & ultimately death!! Where's the mental health resources for these folks? The one thing I learned from coming across addicts, recovering addicts & their families is that they all have some type of unresolved issues. whether it be ADHD (given riddlin as a child) mental or physical abuse, sexual abuse, etc. You can multiply rehabs 100x over but without mental health resources throughout that rehabilitation is completely worthless!! It frustrates me when the addict gets a slap on the wrist and is shooting up in the parking lot at the courthouse. I watched it many times over and over. All it does is create more addicts as the statistics prove!",box,,Other,Other,other.svg,,

Marie,35,Female,Cape May,Cape May,"
My aunt had to bury her first born child, my baby cousin. We all took it hard because he was so young. She took it hardest. Her best friend became a bottle, and it didn�t matter the flavor. It could�ve been wine, vodka, or tequila. It was whatever she could drink. She hid bottles in the trunk, and drove with an �open container�. 
She had several more kids to love and watch grow. The devil possessed her though. Lies became her truths. 
She had entered detox several times, or was hospitalized for whatever reason. There were times her BAC came close to .5, yeah almost half of her bloodstream contaminated by alcohol and benzos.
A call for help resulted in me staying the night, making sure she made it to detox and making sure the kids were safe. Nobody had a bed until the next day. 
That night was hell. 
I don�t know where to begin. She smelled like shit, like she hadn�t showered in weeks, she passed out in a pool of her bodily fluids in her own bed. Her rotten stench actually made me throw up. It was disgusting and tragic that minors were living under that roof. 
At that point, supposedly it was only alcohol. I talked to her on Mothers Day. She told me she had 2 weeks sober. I felt proud and told her ""you've got this, and I love you"". That was my last conversation with her. Two months later, she was found unresponsive and was on life support until everyone could say goodbye. She was gone within seconds.
We found two of her sobriety coins. One was for 90 days. I knew she tried hard.
It wasn�t until several months after her death when the autopsy report said had track marks and other opiates.

Monica,28,Female,Wyckoff,Bergen,"I've been addicted to prescription pain killers since they were prescribed to me after I had my wisdom teeth pulled at the age of 16. The high is extremely addicting and wonderful, I'm not to pretend it isn't. Over the years since then I usually stayed clean, but the last 3 or 4 years I've been doing whatever I can to be on some kind of pain killer. A little bit of pain is a sure fire ED visit for a pain level of 10 for pain meds, etc. After a surgery this year, I've gone through pain meds about every 2 to 3 weeks. Bottles of 20 that are pretty much finished within 3 to 4 days and I have to wait until it's not so obvious to ask for a refill from the doctor. My surgeon has since cut me off. But now I've moved on and found another doctor to write me scripts. I can't stop. I know it's bad, but I don't really want to. It's comforting knowing that I have those pills at home. But when I don't have any, my whole motivation is how I'm going to get more. It's a sickness. I'm a function member of society. I actually have a job where I help other people (I NEVER work while I'm high). But my main goal in life is many pills I have and when I'm going to get high. And if I'm out, how I'll get more. Funny thing though, I'll never try heroin. That is. A line I won't cross.",quote,"When I don't have any, my whole motivation is how I'm going to get more",User,User,syringe.svg,,

I have lost many friends from overdoses, or just being so depressed that drugs didn't even do it for them. They would ""borrow"" from anyone that would lend it, then when they're reputations would go south, they would just start taking things. Anything. Money(duh) , if they couldn't find that, then anything they thought could be worth some money would do. No need to be specific, because it doesn't matter to them. Then a while goes by, and no one's heard from them. Everyone knows, but no one wants to say. Then it's another funeral, and a guessing game about who will be next, and when.

Kim,49,Female,Whippany,Morris,"Our family has been torn apart. We at one time could all be together. The holidays were fun and even though there were issues we all loved each other and could have fun together. The person who turned to heroin lost everything and the rest of us watched as she lost her home. Her kids and all support. We adopted two of her children and that in and of itself was a long and painful process. Everyone in the family had different thoughts on what to do. We all became angry about the situation and she used our anger and frustration to pit all of us against each other. We became the outcasts because she convinced the rest of the family that we targeted her and wanted to take her kids. That she would have gotten them back had we not stepped in. It wasn't true the kids would have gone to strangers. She wasn't getting them back. We were afraid to let them go into the foster care system. Only now we are just starting to heal and be able to get together but it is uncomfortable because she is elephant in the room. We can't have her around but we all miss her and are concerned for where she is and what conditions she is in but we are also some what guilty because we can't help her and we are getting together without her being there. The most heart breaking part is what this has done to her children. When your 10 year old in a moment of sadness asks "" If my mother dies would you tell us?"" I stood there stunned and with tears streaming down my face said of course. The next question was,""but how would you know?""

TR,27,Male,Cliffwood Beach,Monmouth,"I grew up in Cliffwood Beach, a town that has always had its fair share of drugs and dealers, although it seemed to be a well kept secret except to those of us that lived within the town. Growing up as a teen in early 2000s it seemed that the drug of choice for the town was cocaine, with marijuana being all the more common of course.

I started my experimentation with marijuana at 11 years old. At first many of my peers abstained from using marijuana until high school. By high school I was already a recreational user of multiple things. During the experimental days i started with marijuana, tried cocaine, tried DXM, and even had my first taste of opiate bliss via pharmacuetical medications by the age of 14. I really enjoyed the body buzz i got from abusing Vicodin and percocet my friend and I had taken from his mother unbeknownst to her. The first time was like heaven on earth. I remember lying down on my bed feeling as if i was floating above it instead with a warm sedated glow that accompanied the mindset of everything is perfect.

I used it recreationally off and on with the various other drugs i consumed at one time or another, many of which my eventual counselors or peers may have never even heard of. The only constant from the the time i started was marijuana which I used multiple times daily over all of those years. I managed to keep a job, save money, and get straight As all through high school. My family life was fine, my social life was fine, and I even had a high school sweetheart who I loved very much. 

Around the end of my high school years (2006) a small number of people in the town had begun experimenting with oxycodone IR 30mgs (more commonly referred to as blues). Despite the fact that the vast majority of my peers were partying often all together, the people that did blues were originally singled out and even looked down upon. I remember the first person I encountered on blues -- now sadly that's all people have of him - memories. Oxycontin and blues became readily more available and at prices closer to today's heroin prices, with a pill fetching as little as $7.

Fast forward maybe a year or two and as more people generated or displayed their interest in blues and oxys the taboo seemed to slowly fade, and soon enough people that I knew that would even abstain from weed had at least dabbled with pills. By this time, at least in my town, the demand was already beginning to exceed the supply and prices began to rise. 

However, like I mentioned in the beginning, the town was no stranger to dealers and people looking to make easy money, including myself. As more people in the town not only used it but sought out a supply to sell it it became more accessible on a daily basis, which eventually led to addiction for a few people. 

Having done pain killers when I was younger I didn't pay much attention to the sudden surge and continued to experiment with various drugs, although around this time my hard drug of choice to party on was MDMA (ecstacy). I also saw people spiral down into addiction and lose everything and go through any lengths to get the drug. I remember someone even willingly committing disgusting acts or dangerous dares with getting the pills being their only motivation. One of the most notable worst occasions a dealer had told another customer sarcastically to eat shit he wasn't getting the last of his personal stash, to which the customer responded seriously. I thought he was wacked and vowed I would never allow any drug to control me in such a way and with my extensive experience of a variety of substances I almost felt immune to addiction. How wrong I was.

I made mention of my high school sweet heart who I loved very much. We managed to stick together for 7 years before ending it which sadly resulted more than likely as a result of my drug abuse. One night I was arguing with her and she went home, and my friend who I had taken percocet and vicodin with came over after finding himself in the same position with his girlfriend. Free of the women and looking for any excuse to get high we said screw it and did the blues he had in his possession. It had been quite a few years since I had a strong opiate high, but it gave it to me that night.

I remember the next day waking feeling completely refreshed and ready to take on the world - a stark contrast from the horrible withdrawals I'd eventually face. Having sniffed the blues that time vs swallowing the pills I found I enjoyed it quite more, so I sought out more. At first I was doing it once in a blue moon as I had with any other drug other than weed. Then one night while coming down from MDMA and feeling tired and sore and unable to sleep a friend suggested taking some blues he had. I did, and the pill did its job. No more soreness, no headache I got sometimes coming down, and I nodded out till I passed out. 

Needless to say this made the MDMA comedown almost non existent and much more enjoyable experience as a whole, so opiates became a staple in my partying, especially since I was on probation and couldn't smoke. Around that time MDMA was huge and having played a role in its availability at the time I was always around it or heading to raves. As my MDMA usage increased I continued to use blues or oxys to come down, unintentionally increasing my usage.

It didn't take long before I tried blues again without being on MDMA and again I enjoyed it immensely. Any problems vanished. My anxiety, depression all gone. It seemed to be almost a wonder drug for me. I continued using it by that time almost all weekend every weekend. After a little while I noticed I was starting to do it more often so I started keeping track of when I did by making blank events in my phone to change the color of the dates. Flipping through the phones calendar you could see there being less and less days without it as the year progressed until I got to the withdrawal stage.

Once the withdrawals hit, I didn't know what to think at first. I wasn't physically ill just more uneasy and was in denial despite seeing I was doing it daily and my tolerance dramatically increasing.

Within a year of doing it I was running out of funds and became primarily focused on getting high or money to get high to the point that I was kicked out of my house. On top of the financial problems the drug made me extremely irritable to those around me which resulted in me pushing many people away including my mother and my high school sweet heart.

One day I went to my dealers house. By this time the price of blues had doubled if not tripled and as my tolerance grew it seemed to be impossible to afford my habit, until my dealer offered an alternative. Given the option of 5-6 pills if I was lucky or a bun (10 bags) of heroin, I chose the heroin. It seemed like the cheaper alternative at first and was much easier to get with the now dwindling supply of pain pills. 

From there it just got worse and worse, lost all the money I had, ended up homeless, and basically alone. Instead of staying with family and getting my act together i bounced from house to house full of other addicts for quite a few years. At one point I ended up in Keansburg with someone who also used and was prescribed opana which is oxymorphone - the shit blues broke down into once your body metabolized it. We went through the winters with no heat, days and nights with no electric, and even days without food just so we could finance our habits. 

By this time I was completely out of control on it. I should be dead. I've crashed cars driving while high and even managed to overdose a few times without the need for a needle. One night I had sniffed 13 opana - equal to 50 blues roughly fell out and hit my head. My girlfriend who was still with me at the time called 911 and they took me to the hospital. I was pissed that they took me there and even after almost dying sniffed more in the parking lot the minute they released me. 

Around this time my girlfriend decided she had enough and contacting my outta state parents to fill them in. What followed is your typical intervention. I flipped at the thought throwing stuff at my parents car and refusing to go.I vowed to quit on my own but failed repeatedly. Even after going through all of this my girlfriend wanted to be with me and I managed to convince her to try some blues even. She did but she was smart enough thankfully to recognize the situation for what it was, finally put her foot down and left after 7 years. I was destroyed. However in my screwed up mind the answer just so happened to be my problem and I continued to use even more so to cope with the break up. 

I moved back to cliffwood beach to some people that i had known for years but had grown close to a their habits grew. I remember them at the start saying its cool man you can do yours here and breaking up 6 blues and sniffing it all in one shot much to their amazement. I warned them that if they couldn't do that now then its best to quit before they started - advice that went ignored.

The cycle reset again. They slowly went broke, electric off, gas off, house foreclosed. As I continued to stay there another of my lifelong friends came to stay with us, although he himself was also a heroin addict. A few people had partied in the house and fallen out, which is basically being on the verge of completely overdosing and we all just went on like it made no matter. One day though, I felt the harsh reality. While smoking upstairs we heard a loud crash on the floor to which me and my friend responded woops there goes another one. We didn't pay it no mind until the person we thought it had been came upstairs crying in a panic. We rushed downstairs to see my lifelong friend having a seizure, unconscious on the floor with the needle right next to him.

They called 911 and explained what happened panicking and worrying about going to jail. I wasn't worried about jail. I was too focused on my friend on the ground seemingly dying slowly. My friend is spanish and I just remember holding his head in my lap trying to wake him up as he slowly turned white than blue, all the while just thinking oh my god, oh my god hes dying in my arms.

Luckily he came too right as the EMS arrived, before they could administer narcan, but they still sent him to Bayshore hospital and told us that one of us would have to go to pick him up. I agreed to go. My friend whose mother worked at the hospital was displeased to say the least, and not just because his mother might find out. I remember him being pissed off saying ""WTF man its not like its the first time....""

I thought it was completely absurd for him to say this than flashbacked to my own experiences. I knew what I had put my girlfriend and friends through but I never really understood the gravity or emotional toll it can put on those around you until that day. What made it all the more worse was his response was same as mine -- he got high again minute he left.

After failing a semester in college, gone through all of this, loosing my friends, loosing my family, loosing my girlfriend, selling whatever I can get my hands on sentimental or not, and getting up to 1-2 bricks a day (50-100bags) I decided time to quit. I moved to Arizona for a month to get clean and relapsed again. The cycle repeated over and over - suboxone didn't even help any with the withdrawals anymore. Finally after getting arrested with suboxone by a cop who walked up on me in broad daylight because i looked like a druggy I checked myself into IOP at Endeavour house in keyport. I give it some credit to my staying clean although it was a little discouraging having to explain opana and a bunch of other drug things I had done to a rehab.

That was August 2012. Today despite having been around it I've managed to not do any opiates, although I concede that I almost feel back into the same vicious cycle but with cocaine. Both my friend I initially tried it with and the one that overdosed still battle it. Its a tough battle though and I tell them not to get discouraged at the inevitable failed attempts. For those who don't know what its like to have to experience addiction or withdrawals be thankful. Picture that overwhelming urge you get for your next cigarette amplified and only made all the more harder to curb by the physical withdrawals that feel like the worst flu x1000. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy and several other addicts along with myself have said they probably would have shot themselves if they had a gun at the time, that's how bad it could get. I don't know I guess in the end I was lucky.

However, not everyone was so lucky.

1 woman i Knew died of respiratory depression due to the combination of her being on opana and nodding out without her sleep apnea mask.

1 died crashing the car nodding out on way home.

3 friends overdosed and died as a result just in 2014--2015

1 of my dealers had gotten clean relapsed and died not to long after.

That's 6 lives gone, not to mention the numerous ones ruined

I know 3 couples who have lost their rights to their kid because they cant quit heroin long enough to get their lives together. Another father who isn't allowed to see his son. The man i lived with in keansburg lost visitation of his daughter.

3 different women, including an extremely reserved introvert I grew up with have resulted in prostituting to support their habit at one time or another.

7 people in the last two years, including myself, have been arrested or are currently facing criminal charges. 

Some friends and family still refuse to talk to me and even after a few years Im still trying to fix my credit and pay back money i begged for, borrowed, or sadly even stole.

Susan,58,Female,Hamilton,Mercer,"My brother has been addicted to some type of drug for over 30 years. At first it was Crack Cocaine. He lived with my mother, told lies to the family and stole from her and others. He spent time in jail for some of his offences, but mom always took him back. In 2000, mom sold her home and he was forced to try to make it on his own. Due to several back injuries and surgery he could not work. When he finally received a large settlement due to a law suite and disability payout, he spent it all in a few months - probably on drugs. He was addicted to pain meds and when he could no longer get those he turned to heroin. He admitted to his family that he had a problem a few years ago. He had overdosed previously but he was found by a friend in time to save his life. Of course he started using again. Last March he had an incident that took him into the hospital. To this day we do not know if he overdosed on Heroin, or had a stroke. He was put into long term nursing home. He could not speak, feed himself or walk- he wore a diaper. The diagnosis was Substance Abuse Related Dementia. Several months later he began to regain his faculties. He is still in the nursing home, and resides with the dementia patients. He is safe and no longer taking drugs. If he were out on the street he would probably be a user again. My family has been affected by his addiction and his horrible choices for decades. His addictions took away the chance to have a normal life. But maybe he is one of the lucky ones. 
He is alive.",box,,Family,Family,family.svg,,

John,37,Male,Springfield,Union,"I first tried heroin in 1997 when a guy who I bought Marijuana from offered me a bump. I sniffed it 2 or 3 more times over the next few months. In early 1998 I met a girl at a NA meeting ironically enough. She introduced me to IV use personally injecting me for the 1st time in the parking lot of another NA meeting. I couldn't get enough. I soon joined her and her drug buddies on statewide mass shoplifting trips where we resold the items to support our habits. I was arrested 3 times that summer and after spending a few days in jail decided to get myself help and managed to get off the drug. Although now clean damage had been done. My family wouldn't talk to me for the next 7 years and I missed my chance to graduate high school and go to college resulting in long periods of unemployment and when I did finally find work the only job I could get was pizza delivery. In 2004 I learned that a new friend of a friend used heroin . I only intended to get high once just for old times sake but I went on a 14 month binge that ended when I got on suboxone in late 2005. In 2011 I got a subscription for Clonopin for anxiety and began abusing the clonopin. When my Clonopin ran out I began buying Xanax in the street in Newark where I once again began injecting dope. I managed to sober up long enough to get married to my long time GF who does not use. I soon relapsed again. For the next 3 years I used on and off. I soon found out my GF was pregnant and I managed to stay clean. My daughter was born 3 years ago and I quit once and for all. She saved my life. I would be dead had she never been born. The damage has been done however. I still suffer from depression caused by my previous heroin use. I have a 2 inch long track mark on my arm which people occasionally ask about when I wear short sleeves. Ive crashed several cars while high. Once passing out while driving and crossing into oncoming traffic narrowly missing a head on collision. My family will never trust me 100 percent ever again and many opportunities are lost forever. Everyone I meet I always wonder ""do they know"" I live with overwhelming guilt and shame everyday for the damage my addiction caused. I am lucky to be alive. I thank God that I beat the e odds and survived and for blessing me with my daughter. It is an absolute miracle that I am alive and not in prison today.",quote,It is an absolute miracle that I am alive and not in prison today.,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,

Jennifer,38,Female,Tinton Falls,Monmouth,"Heroin robbed us of my brother. I didn't want to believe it the first time I found out my brother was using. I wanted to believe him, the sweet boy I watched grow up. I wanted to believe he was still our sweet brother. 
He wasn't some loser. He was a loving, caring person. A popular, smart young man that had hopes and dreams. Dreams that would never be realized. The drugs took all of that away from him and from us. 
It started with prescription pills, there had been an accident. Then the heroin seemed to creep in slowly and took over not just his life but all of our lives with worry and fear. In reality it worked swiftly, killing him within only a few years. 
He was kicked out of college. He lost his license. He grew so sick and spent months on end in hospitals. My parents and I never gave up on him. He had so many options available. But nothing could help him. 
There was hope- he was clean almost for a year. He went back to college, he was back on track destined for bigger and better things. 
Our other brother got married, the family was brought together. It would be the last time we were all together.He died a week later from a drug overdose. I hang onto that last hug, standing in the street. I can still feel his beard brush up against my cheek. I hang onto that moment as tightly as I can.
Two years have passed and it doesn't get easier. When I lost my brother I lost a chunk of my heart and soul, he was torn away from me in the prime of life. I will never get to talk to him again or laugh with him. I miss him so much.

It wasn't until I went to jail for a longer period of time that I decided enough was enough. I looked like shit I was homeless and everyone pretty much hated me cause I had stolen one thing or another from them. I didn't go to meetings. I didn't do a long term program or halfway house.

Elizabeth,45,Female,Brick,Ocean,"After knee surgery my husband became addicted to prescription pain killers and when the pills ran out, yes, he used heroin. I never once suspected he was doing this, even though I found him countless times throwing up, spacing out, lieing through his teeth, taking our money, nodding off, not to mention the mood swings me and my two children had to endure. I love my husband and I stuck by him and demanded he get clean. This was more than 2 years ago. He now has a good job, he's more involved with our kids, but trust is still an ongoing issue. It takes years to restore. My advise to someone who may be in a similar situation, things can get better but be careful....don't trust the addict, question EVERYTHING your doctor prescribes, and do not tolerate people who enable the addict, whether it be friend or family.

Susan,48,Female,Wildwood,Cape May,"My Son was a heroin addict. It started over 10 years ago. My Son and I lived with my parents. He was around 17 at the time. We had no idea that heroin was in the beginning of becoming epidemic. I would miss cash, my checks would bounce, my jewelry would be missing. I would think I was crazy and misplacing things. My Mom was missing jewelry also. I was in denial. I did not want to believe that my Son was stealing from us. Eventually, I couldn't deny it anymore. My parents were his biggest enablers which was ripping our family apart. This went on for years. Two stints in rehab. He would start using again as soon as he got home. My Dad financed his suboxene for several years but he was selling it to buy heroin. My Dad paid his legal fees. In the end, my parents had to reverse mortgage their home, sell their car that was paid for, and we're living off credit cards. My Mom and I lost all of our jewelry. My Son was diagnosed with hepatitis. Finally, with the threat of jail hanging over his head, my Son went on Methadone. It saved his life. I know there are mixed reviews on Methadone, but I truly believe that my Son would not be alive today if he didn't take that step. I am an advocate for replacement therapy. It may no be for everyone but it saved my Son's life. My parents got to see their beloved Grandson clean before they passed away. I have my Son back. He has since moved to Connecticut, has a job with health benefits, purchased a home, got married, and is working on starting a family of his own. He is still on Methadone. Although my family was ripped apart financially and emotionally, I know I am blessed. Not everyone is as fortunate as I am to still have their child. A few years ago I did not think that would be possible. I was actually trying to prepare myself mentally for his death.

Until you live it and until it effects your family you should have some understanding and caring. My son has been using on and off for over 15 years and he is still trying to get help. In the beginning when he was on our insurance plan the company wouldn't pay for him to go to rehab and of course we couldn't afford to pay out of pocket. He ended up getting into trouble with the law so was appointed court rehab and didn't take that serious when they told him right away ""You will be back"" so he figure why should I try.
I am in retirement age and I don't have anything to look forward to don't have enough money, my son still needs help, I still keep my bedroom door lock cause I can't get that trust back and the worst part is he is a kind and loving person. He wants to change so bad a couple of months ago he admitted himself into a hospital and told them he wanted to kill himself so they detox him and told him they would send him to a half way house after finally finding him one that would take charity care they told him that it will not be ready for 2 weeks and he would have to leave the hospital cause he couldn't stay there any longer so he called home and asked could he please come home for just those 2 weeks. Of course we took him and in the first week when he called the half way house they asked him where he was staying and he told them they told him the room will not be ready for anther couple more weeks. Well he has been calling every week since then and now we are going on 7 weeks and they either don't take his calls or they tell him there is no beds yet. Now I know the reason why they don't take his calls is because they know he is home now, he would have been better off lieing and saying he was living on the streets and maybe they would have helped him. So now we are back again to getting no help, he has no insurance, no job, no car, and we live where there is no public transporation so you know it is going to be just a matter of time and he is going to lose it and be right back to where he was. The only thing that he has been doing on a regular basis is going to AA meetings but I am the one who has to drive him there each night. I just don't understand why do people lie and tell them they are going to help you and then don't come through for you, why isn't there someplace where they can get help.

We love him so much....so it's just like them dying, when they get hooked. Then you die a little more each day with them when you see them struggle-hurt themselves-and change.
The drugs & the dealers are demons, stealing our loved ones!

I don't understand why & how this happened to our beautiful son, who had a bright future.
My husband and daughters hurt so much too.

Laura,47,Female,Piscataway,Middlesex,"My son started with smoking weed at around 14 (which is what I know of). It then went onto taking pills then to snorting pills.He has told me when he started with heroin he didn't inject because he felt that was for ""lowlifes."" Needless to say he went on to injecting it because the high was better. My husband and I have been watching this decline and trying to help for over 8 years now. His biological father died of an overdoes in 2010. I now hear stories of his biological father providing my son with pills to sell and that is how my ex made money. My son is now 23 and was just released from jail after spending 30 days for shoplifting. We would not bail him out but let him come home thinking this is the first time he went to jail and doesn't ever want to go back. He is back using and is living on the streets.

The stress on the family has been tremendous. The emotional toll on me has been the greatest. My health has declined and I suffer from depression. I have alienated myself from so many family members and friends. I worry about him all the time and it seems like I just wait for the phone to ring to hear that we overdosed. It wasn't any easier walking up the stairs to his room to see if he was dead and I couldn't put his brothers or his sister through that anymore.",quote,The stress on the family has been tremendous.

Dayna,21,Female,Oak Ridge,Morris,"My father was addicted to Heroin. I remembered going to my Grandma's where he lived on the weekend to visit him. Then i remember not seeing him at all. For years i did not see or hear from him, come to find out later on when i was just old enough to understand, i had found out he was in prison. Once he was out of prison he moved to Florida with my Uncle and again years of absence on his part. Still even after doing his time he relayed back to the drug and fell off the deep end. After a few years in Florida my Uncle passed away and my Father moved back to New Jersey. Things are foggy now to me because i did not know every detail i knew what my Grandmother was telling me what my Mother was telling me. However what i do remember clearly is my Father moving to a halfway/3/4 house in Newark. Things were finally looking up for him with his addiction and things were finally looking up for our father- daughter relationship. He was clean from any drug, he was motivated, helping others, helping his self, feeding the homeless even though he barely had a home. My father and I were finally bonding, finally having the father daughter relationship i was jipped from my whole life. But then my father was hospitalized. He was sweating, he was cold, he was weak, he was fatigued. I received a phone call and a visit from my grandmother later that afternoon explaining what was going on. My father had a infection in his heart from the use of needles when he was using Heroin. He underwent heart surgery and recovered very well. We got to spend Christmas together that year. Things really felt normal again, i felt like i had a Dad for the first time. About a year after the surgery on May 27th of 2010 my father passed away. The infection that made him sick in the first place came back. The walls of his heart were scraped too many times for doctors to even attempt surgery again. They kept him comfortable for as long as possible. May 27th my Grandma, Uncle and Aunt were right there by his side when he passed holding his hand as he softly left us and began his journey as my guardian angle. I write this for everyone to read because i want people to know that using Heroin does not just effect you when you're using it, it can effect you even years after you are clean. My heart hurts for each and every addict out there because there is so much more to this life then to poison yourself's. I hope people read this and understand the true meaning of this story and realize that there is a beautiful world out there and its all in your hands to control it. I am who i am today because of so many reasons but the biggest one is my fathers mistake, i learned from it and i can only hope other will learn from it as well.",box,,Family,Family,family.svg,,
Lewis,30,Male,Pitman,Gloucester,"Starting out it was fun and amazing, it gave me confidence, endurance, and strength. I could work longer and harder at my job and during intercourse. I loved it but that quickly changed I was struggling with addiction since I was 18 years old After going through two years of chemotherapy and surgeries from having lymphoma cancer. I didn't realize I had a problem I didn't think it was that bad I just thought I liked to have fun and I would and could stop when I had to or wanted. By the age of 20 I was facing an armed robbery charge sitting in county jail going through withdrawal I hadn't realized what I have done or how serious this addiction has become until now . This was my first offense ever and first time I had been in jail I thought I was gong to get a slap on the wrist and sent home I sat and sat and sat waiting for my court dates by the time I was finally released I was almost 22 and institunialize. I continued to use and had been in and out of jail a half a dozen times to 4 rehabs ,one being in Florida. At one point ,I had a nice amount of clean time because I was on drug court and was stipulated to stay clean with random and weekly drug testing ,in which, I completed drug court after 2 1/2 years (sanction less) meaning no failed drug tests and no new charges and a full time college student. I understood what living clean felt like for the first time and I loved it. I thought I was good and had it under control life was starting to work in my favor I was out and thought I was able to drink bc drinking was not my drug ,I like herion not alcohol. So I drank which quickly landed me back in Camden with a needle in my arm homeless and on the missing persons list. Nowhere to sleep nothing to eat I slept in the bushes next to cooper hospital for a while and ate out of dumpsters. I didn't care the hunger was unbearable I manipulated and stole just to feed my addiction not myself. March 25, 2013 I changed my life I made a decision and stuck with that since I now have a family a good job I'm in the union and have my own house I drive legally and not in fear of getting pulled over. Life is not easy it's a constant struggle trying to people please and to be accepted into society. My credit sucks my car is not the best but I am trying my hardest working my butt off to make sure my 3 children are fed and have a place to call home . The thoughts never leave but entertaining the thoughts are not what I do today. But t I love the life I live I have more than anything I every thought and I am capable of anything. I never choose to be an addict I didn't want this. I didn't wake up one day and say I want to shoot herion but I somehow ended up with the addiction and now today I know how to deal with it and not picking up I choose Na meetings to help keep myself stay clean but some choose church or other support groups but I like narcotics anonymous(Na). My family does not loose sleep over worrying if I'm dead or if I'm stealing from them trust is being built and relationships are getting better some will never be the same but the ones that matter accept me as an addict and love me unconditionally. I'll never be able to drink or or go out to certain places or to hangout with my old friends and that is ok with me . Life today has its bad days but my worse day clean is better than my best day using.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Sarah,31,Female,Keansburg,Monmouth,"My fiancﾕ__ started using blues in 2011(snorting them) after a close friend got him into them. He used for a year without me even noticing. After the first year his addiction to blues had gotten out of control. He started stealing money from my wallet and taking all of the money out of the bank for bills. I caught on and as an addict he lied and told me all kinds of places the money went. I told him he needed to get clean or I was taking our child and leaving he did. He was clean three weeks. He stared using again this time worse. We had no money the second he got his check he would instantly spend it. I told him this is his final chance to get his life together and figured the best option would be to move back to our hometown in pa. He picked up and left everything behind here in no. He stayed clean in pa for about a month or two. In that time I had become pregnant with our second child. He started using almost instantly after finding out. This time he went to heroine as it is so much cheaper. He literally became a doped up zombie always high always disappearing leaving me home all day pregnantand with a four year old. He didn't care about us he only cared about getting that next fix! This went on for so long my entire pregnancy! I gave birth to our second child as he was withdrawing in the hospital bed next to me! He vowed to stay clean and be the father and man I knew he was before this. He stayed clean a year! Being as we lost our home due to his addiction I gave birth homeless with my older child with family for a week we stayed in a hotel to try to figure out our next step! After much family influence we decided to go back to nj most of his family is here and we thought it would be a good support system for him to stay clean! It was a good decision as he remained clean holding a job and being a great father! After getting laid off he became depressed! We had no money he turned to what he knew heroine! This relapse was the worst yet! He took every ting selling my sons Xbox all my jewlery everything we had was no more! He was never home always shooting up with his ""friends"".! I got a job we needed money and left the kids with family while I worked! Our relationship was destroyed no trust no love no anything I didn't want him I didn't want him around his children! He didn't even care! One Friday I went to get my paycheck and thought I had to work turns out I read my schedule wron I was off! He was home with the kids until Someone came to get them! I came home and he wasn't anywhere I asked my son ""where's daddy"" he said bathroom! I opened the door to find him sitting there shooting up while my two children were watching cartoons! That was it the final straw I made him seek help! He needed rehab he couldn't do it alone! He agreed to go he did three months! He has now been clean for over a year and for the first time in four years my mind can rest easy! He's got an amazing job and I see a difference in him this time I don't fear a relapse this time he's working on himself and that's what's most important! I can't wait to see what the years have to bring as he continues to grow as a person and stays on the clean path!!

My cousin and I grew up together, he has been one of my closest friends. He has always been a smart boy, full of energy, and one the biggest joys in our family. Since we were young he was the first one to start dancing at family parties and always looked for ways to make our family laugh. In his teenage years, I noticed that he was being distant and different from who he had always been, the shine in his face was missing and had to been replaced with a dull demeanor. My interactions with him were now different, I realized he did not trust me and he would get caught up in his own lies. I would not see him for long periods of time, later coming to find out he has been sent to treatments that always failed. The longest I went without seeing him was about a year, which was heart breaking. I remember last Christmas he decided to come around, although still addicted, it was one of the best gifts I could have received, to see my little cousin.

Cathee,55,Female,Nutley,Essex,"In Oct 2008 of my son's senior year I was informed my son had a heroin addiction. I am not a parent who says ""not my kid"" and have always been extremely hands on and involved in their life. ( I am a single parent) The first thing that his guidance counselor and Vice Principal said ""what are you talking about? He doesn't match the demographics!!"" The Vice Principal, a male, was visibly shaken and tearful. This was a kid never in trouble, well liked by everyone and extremely responsible. Even had his own landscape business since he had been 10.

Within 24 hrs of finding out my sons heroin addiction he was in rehab, I had taken his car, cell phone and had quit both his jobs. Because he was still 17 I still had a say on his medical care. The hospital asked if he could be given Suboxen to minimize the with drawl effects of the heroin. Once I learned that NOT having it wouldn't have any long term affects I chose for him NOT to have it. Instead I crawled up on the gurney and held him while he shook, sweat and writhed in pain. I wanted it to hurt and told him this would never happen again.

You are correct marijuana is not a gateway drug, prescription pain killers are. That is how Jonathan started. While at a party someone said ""try this, it makes you feel great."" That was his first time using heroin. He had no idea what he had just used and was sorry when he found out, but tried it again. Said he was hooked after the second time!

Today my son is Heroin free 8 years. I couldn't be more proud. He has gone to college, got his real estate license and works full time. He has never forgotten what he went through and is truly grateful for each day. However he wanted a clean life badly and he did all the things taught to him in a 12 step program.

Amanda,24,Female,Anonymous,Sussex,"I was brought up in an extremely loving and supportive family. I was a quiet, very shy child. I was afraid of people. I suffered from anxiety and stress at a very young age and was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder. All through school, I got good marks and participated in sports. Around the age 13, I started to come out of my shell. I became the funny girl in school. At the same age, I tried marijuana for the first time. From that moment on, all I thought about was drugs. At age 14 I graduated to prescription pain pills. The first time I used these pills, I took an enormous amount. I did not OD but I was high for two days. The feeling was the most amazing thing in the entire world. I didn't care about the stomach pain or sickness it caused. I was obsessed. I quickly began using these pills regularly. When I was 15, my father was involved in a terrible car accident. My family was devastated. I was crushed but nothing stopped me from the drugs. My father was prescribed massive amounts of prescription pain killers for his pain. I got my hands on as many as I could. Eventually he noticed and confronted me. I denied his accusations. I continued to steal his pills and he began to hide them. I would always find them. It got the the point where my father had to carry the pills in his pockets at all times. I started buying the pills but with a daily habit and a growing tolerance, that was getting very expensive. I remember complaining about the prices and someone saying ""I know something that is stronger and cheaper."" I asked what it was called thinking it would be another pill. He replied ""heroin"". I did not think twice and I began using heroin that day. Eventually my tolerance grew and buying heroin became too expensive as well. Someone directed me to Paterson where it was half price sometimes even cheaper. I began buying wholesale. I got money from where ever I could. I was still a senior in high school and tried to drop out. My school convinced me I was too bright to drop out and offered me bedside for my ""anxiety"". I was so manipulative I got what ever I wanted. I only went to school a few hours a week after everyone else had left. It gave me plenty of extra time to make money and go to Paterson. In September I was nominated for homecoming queen and voted class clown, by December I was spending my days scamming and copping dope. I was completely dependent on opiates. I would become very ill everyday until I was able to use drugs. I was getting worse everyday. I graduated high school and moved on to community college. I was no longer taking school seriously. I took nothing seriously. The only thing that was of any concern to me was heroin. At that point snorting heroin was becoming too expensive so I began to shoot up. I feared nothing. I was barely out of high school going to the block by myself on a regular basis. All my friends were fake. We called each other friends but the most time we spent together was an hour or two shooting dope or taking a trip to Paterson. The only two people who I would still consider my friends are now gone. They were a married couple who I had become very close with. The man was a disabled veteran who became addicted to pain pills after and injury during the Gulf War. He was prescribed painkillers but he abused them as well as heroin. His wife was the only person I had ever known who used heroin once in a while. These two people were the only ones who saw the good left inside me. They tried to help me get clean on numerous occasions and I never even tried. I ended up bringing them down with me. One day I stopped by their house after work. I found the woman dead in her home of a heroin overdose. She was my best friend. I woke her husband who was passed out in the other room and informed him. I stayed while he called 911, then left immediately. I was devastated. Not even this got me clean. I continued using for another two months. The man ended up dying of and overdose two months after I got clean. I think about them both every single day. On October 16th, 2011 someone who was mad at me told my parents I was using heroin. While my parents were suspicious of my drug use, they never expected me to be using heroin. They thought I was smarter than that. I remember crying hysterically. My parents were so supportive but they wanted me to detox at home to learn my lesson. They had no idea how bad it was going to be. I had no idea either. My clean date is October 17th, 2011. I had been using opiates on a daily basis for six years. The longest period of time I had experienced withdrawal from heroin was eight hours as I tried to collect money for my 50+ bag a day habit. For the most part my sickness did not extend past a few moments after I woke up. I thought I had experienced withdrawal before but the truth was that waking up and being sick a few minutes while getting my drugs ready was nothing compared to completely detoxing. I was violently ill for weeks. I did not sleep for months. I thought I was going to die. I wished I would die. My parents never left my side. There was always someone there to watch me and take care of me. After about a month of detoxing, I was able to leave the house without being sick. My dad took me to my first NA meeting. That was the start of my new life. I attended meeting regularly and began to learn how to live. I had to learn how to do everything all over again because I didn't know how to do anything without drugs. My uncle was in rehab for my first year clean. He got out and we attended meetings together. About 3 months after he got out, I met a very nice boy who was my age at my NA meetings who had just got out of rehab. My uncle introduced me to him. They had been in rehab together and were very close friends. I am now married to that boy. Everything I have in my life I got from NA meetings, including my husband. While I owe a lot to NA, I owe the most to my family for sticking by me through everything. My two great uncles were also addicts. They were my nana's older brothers. My great grandmother used to tell my nana when she was little ""No one wakes up one day and decides to become a drug addict"". My nana passed that on to me. I am a 24 year old recovering heroin addict. I have been clean for over four years. I am married, employed, and live a normal life. I am far from the person I used to be. I don't have to live like that anymore.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,

I��_��__m not that kind of girl, you took your vow and now I wear your wedding ring.
I take you from your family and friends; I steal your soul and heart.
And I take very seriously the vow of ��_��__till death do us part��_��__.
I��_��__m not the kind of girl that you take home to your mother.
But the secret thrill of me is like no other.
When I��_��__m not around, you��_��__ll crave me so much you��_��__ll be sick.
You��_��__ll sneak, lie, steal and cheat just to get with me for your next ��_��__fix��_��__.
I��_��__m so exciting and dangerous, but you��_��__ve known that all along.

Don��_��__t think you��_��__re the only one I��_��__ve ever taken for a ride.
I don��_��__t discriminate, rich or poor, young or old, smart or fool. It doesn��_��__t matter once you decide.

Farewell, sweet chemical romance, I over came another one
With my awesomeness and beauty, and now you are done.
Your family is in tatters, they��_��__ve been shattered by your addiction.
Is that what you wanted for them, a lifelong affliction?
No ��_��__ They will never get over it. They��_��__re not like me, they won��_��__t move on.
They will never be the same now that you��_��__re gone.
Your mother is broken, she shakes and cries. Your father tries to keep her sane.
While he pushes down his own feelings of guilt and pain.
Your brothers, Hell, they miss you. You were the oldest and their leader.
Your Aunt wishes she had one more time to tell you that she loves you-
And if anyone could take your place, it would be her.
And your grandparents are so very sad, it��_��__s not the way it��_��__s supposed to be.
But you didn��_��__t see this; I blinded you with my charms and beauty.
And now I go on to the next, like it��_��__s my duty.

After...he served over a year in prison for a drug related crime. He was newly released from rehab before he died from an overdose. His wife found him, face down on a Sunday afternoon, in their family room. She told their sons, and others, that he died of a heart attack. I chose to tell my children, and others, the truth. I have had no contact with them since his funeral. I don't know if the lack of a headstone is her way of punishing him or she just couldn't face it. It tore my family apart.

Jennifer,26,Female,Beachwood,Ocean,"I fell madly in love with my wonderful boyfriend last summer. He had a personality quite like no other person I've ever known, and he had a sense of humor that could make anyone laugh... it was almost impossible for anyone to not fall in love with him. I soon learned of his addiction, but he was who I was in love with. When my family learned of his addiction, it started to ruin my relationships with them. I stuck by his side through it all and had an undying amount of faith in him, despite the fact that I had known him for such a small amount of time. I wasn't stupid either, I knew what I was dealing with as I had lost my best friend to an overdose just barely a year earlier. But soon, my boyfriend's withdrawal symptoms stopped and he passed the drug tests I gave him. He got a job, found a place to live, and was doing very well for himself. I was so proud of him, and I felt on top of the world with this wonderful man who I wanted to spend my life with. That is, until the day I returned home from work to his cold, lifeless body lying on the floor, surrounded by open bags of heroin. At first, it was almost like a terrible nightmare that I could only hope to wake up from. But the guilt and depression soon sunk in, and I couldn't grasp the fact that this man, who was always so full of life and would do anything to put a smile on my face, was no longer living because he was secretly dying inside. I'll never know what exactly happened to him when I left for work that morning: whether or not he suffered or if he cared, if he wanted to die or if he thought about me at all... and those realizations made continuing on with my life extremely hard. I felt almost like it was my fault... like I couldn't make him happy enough to not have to turn to heroin. It's been well over a year, and I still think about him daily, and the photos I have of us I have plastered all over my bedroom remind me of all the amazing memories I have of him... of the laughs we shared and the stories of his childhood he told me, of the tears he cried and the late night secrets we shared, the movies we watched and the songs we used to dance to in my car together, of the moments when I woke up next to him with the slight sound of rain hitting the window and the slight sight of the sunlight shining through the curtains hitting his perfect face. He was never a heroin addict to me, he was my boyfriend. I always saw him as nothing less than the man I was in love with. And despite his addiction, he was perfect to me. I'll remember him fondly everyday of my life. And I'll love him everyday until the day I die.",quote,I'll never know what exactly happened to him when I left for work that morning,Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,

It didn't take long for things to unravel and come undone like a tornado heroin had wripped havoc through our lives and ruined everything we built together.

Scott,36,Male,Pennsville,Salem,"No one starts using opiates with the goal of destroying lives - their own and all those around them. Opiates just *feel good*; all pain, physical and emotional goes away. It's like being snuggled up in a warm fuzzy blanket of joy. Since you're wrapped in this blanket you don't feel the concrete being poured on you. When that blanket goes away, or becomes threadbare over time... You are buried alive; cold rough concrete rubs against you; no one can hear your screams. There is a choice, but what is right and what is easy are rarely the same. Scratch and pound away at the concrete coffin, trying to break free in darkness and pain - knuckles bloodied, nails broken, with no one able to help - this is something that must be done alone. Sounds like fun, right? The easy choice is to wrap yourself in the blanket of joy. Is ignorance bliss? Perhaps. It all comes down to one of my favorite lines in The Shawshank Redemption: ""Get busy living or get busy dying.""

Metaphors aside, at this point the short term reward system of the brain has been rewired to believe that the opiate is just as important as air and water to survival. Think about that. How long can you hold your breath? How long can you go without water? The right choice - get busy living - is painful. When I made this choice I not only felt the pain of clawing out of that concrete, but once out I felt ashamed, embarrassed, and ultimately confused about exactly what I was feeling. I was naked. Alone. Scared. Vulnerable. Stigmatized. Marginalized. During this period of pain, shame, guilt, and confusion some people applauded me for having overcome the physical addiction, but the words were meaningless and brought uncomfortable feelings. I felt like a phoney - the overpowering shame - I was a worthless ""bad"" person, not worthy of love or applause. The real challenge began then - overcoming the psychological addiction. The ability to understand what I was feeling was the first step of a long road. That first step took a long time with nonstop practice in discovering myself. In the beginning I would carry around a sheet with different faces on it, each labeled with a feeling. When asked how I felt I would look at the faces until I found one that struck a chord. Then I'd read the label and think ""Yeah - that's it! That is how I feel."" Now I was able to identify and put words to my feelings. After a month of using the sheet of faces, my emotional awareness and vocabulary had progressed to a point where I no longer needed a sheet with labeled faces. It was replaced with several pages of emotions grouped into categories so I could narrow down and label my feelings (plural now - not just one emotion). Now the big question: Why do I feel this way and how does this feeling affect my behavior? This gets to the root of the false beliefs I held subconsciously - a set of beliefs that are ultimately the source of my compulsive and destructive behavior. For eleven months I kept a journal, making about six entries per day; each day when I would feel ""some kinda way"", I would identify the emotions and which false beliefs led me to feel, think, and behave. For example, at a cafeteria the person in front of me got a much larger serving of bacon. I like bacon dammit! I felt disrespected, cheated, anger rooted in jealousy, and frustrated. Why did I feel this way? It's because I believe that the world should be fair. But the world isn't fair and I choose to accept that since I have no way to change it. By recognizing these false beliefs of an addictive mind I was able to change my behavior. Instead of subconsciously using a pathological, immature, or neurotic defense mechanism (e.g., arguing with the bacon man (acting out), projection, displacement, etc.) I use mature defense mechanisms and coping skills, each time examining my thinking and writing in my journal. Every day I grow; the only constant is change.

The addictive belief system is the problem - recognizing it, changing these beliefs, and coping with uncomfortable emotions is the solution. We live in a society of the ""quick fix"". This is exactly the type of thinking that leads to addiction of all forms: substance abuse, gambling, shopping, eating, stealing, love, sex, drama. The stigma of addiction must be lifted. I believe that everyone has been affected by addiction at some point in their lives. Those in active addiction and early recovery are our family members, our loved ones, our fellow humans. And they are suffering. Love them, but do not enable them; that only leads to codependency (addiction to an addict) and a vicious cycle of unhealthy relationships. Learn about addiction by reading these stories. Personally, I view addiction as a biopsychosocial disorder, not a disease or allergy. There is great wisdom in the 12 step programs and the 16 step programs; I read the literature regularly. It augments my primary method of recovery: Smart Recovery, a 4 point program based in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (a form of Cognitive Behavior Therapy). It can be summed up with a quote from Epictetus: ""People are disturbed not by things but by their view of things."" How we think influences how we feel which influences how we act. By learning and using techniques to change the way we think, our view of things, changes the way we feel and behave. Four books stand out as the pillars of my recovery and understanding of myself and recovery from addiction: ""Willpower's Not Enough"" by Arnold Washington and Donna Boundy; ""The SMART Recovery Handbook"" www.smartrecovery.org; ""The Sermon on the Mount"" by Emmet Fox; ""Touchstones: Daily Meditations for Men"" Hazelden.

This super-short story of my addiction and recovery is given to you as a message of experience, strength, and hope. Please set aside some time to read the stories in this article; there will undoubtedly be a message that resonates with you. I am grateful for the pain of my past. Life is lessons and blessings. What at the time seemed to be a terrible situation is now seen as a lesson, a blessing. To all that have been or are affected by addiction: Keep hope and choose to surrender; paradoxically, surrender is the only way to win. God, grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

Jay,25,Male,Boonton,Morris,"Heroin and opiates consume your life. Addiction is like having a child. You need to cater to it, feed it, nurture it, and give it everything it needs to survive.

Vicky,50,Female,Howell,Monmouth,"My family was hit hard by the disease of addiction. It started with one of my children and eventually captured two of my children in it's cage. There is no one right way to deal with an addicted love one and there is no one wrong way. What works for one may not work for another. Both of my children took different paths toward their own recovery and continue to fight the battle daily. Recovery is not a cure, the damage done to the brain takes many years to repair, if ever and the cravings do not go away simply because you ""quit"". Society has come to understand that alcoholism is a disease but has yet to come to the same understanding with drug addiction. In fact addiction is a progressive but treatable, incurable disease and should be treated as such. The family of the drug addict suffers right along with the addict with the only difference being that the family actually feels the damage being done while the addict feels nothing that they choose not to. The lying is minimal when compared to the lengths an addict will go to in order to obtain what they need. There is no way to describe how it feels for your own child to steal every single thing that you own, or how it feels to watch your child steal from your non addicted child. The damage done to relationships in the family unit is heartbreaking and sometimes cannot be repaired. In my family the decision to not help was the only decision left. I spent more years than I can remember trying to ""fix"" my children or clean up their mess or apologize for what they had done. I spent days on end not speaking to friends or family for fear I would breakdown from the stress of it all. In the end the stolen items are not really what has been lost, it is the trust and pride in family that has ben lost and may never be found again. There will forever be a hole in my heart , a space that should have been filled with the happy memories of watching my children grow and succeed. If I could go back and recapture those days to do over I would give anything but I am left to forever miss what could have, what should have been. It is not in the raising of the child that creates an addict although most believe this to be the case, often the parent of the addict is blamed for the addicts behavior and problem but I have seen first hand how one child can be addicted and the other be a doctor, yet both be raised in the same home by the same people. Of my wishes for the rest of my life I wish for a successful treatment for drug addiction and I wish parents understood that the blame is not upon their shoulders> No one is to blame for a disease, this is the hardest thing I have ever had to learn.",box,,Parent,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Mike,34,Male,South Brunswick,Middlesex,"Heroin was always a drug that fascinated me. But I certainly was never going to try it. But all of that changed when I found out how much I loved opioid pain killers. I spent a few months taking pills every day. It wasn't long before I was feeling very sick one morning, my pill guy couldn't get me anything, and a guy with heroin happened to get in touch with me. ""It's the same thing,"" he said. So, as the withdrawal became more intense, I relented, opened that little glassine envelope, poured out its contents, made a few little lines, and began a journey that would cost me almost everything. The first thing that I thought was, ""he's right."" This is exactly like the pills, only it's a quarter of the price. There was a part of me that thought that was awesome. But there was also a part of me that knew I was in a lot of trouble. Years later, after a lot of suffering, I'm clean and sober. I have a great life today. I share my story because maybe it will give someone who is struggling today the hope that they need. I wish our government would end the War On Drugs and let medical professionals handle addiction. I feel for all of those people in jail because of drugs. They certainly don't belong in a cage. If you are suffering from addiction, get some help, and get clean. There is hope. You don't have to die with a needle in your arm.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Rick,62,Male,Parsippany,Morris,"Our daughter is now 28 and resides in Florida and this is her short story on her road to recovery. It all started one day when she had her 2nd car accident. The 2nd accident happened 6 days after she had picked up her 2nd car. I got her cell phone and started checking her calls and found many of them to Newark. This was the start of our days in hell. It started when she was 17 and finally ended at 24. We had no idea she was doing heroin. She has been in and out of rehab facilities both in New Jersey and Florida. Lucky for her my insurance covered most of the rehabs but not all. As parents we were devastated to find out that our daughter was doing drugs. Her last hurrah was when she was 24. My wife and I had not heard from her in 3 weeks. During that time I was ready to fly and search for her. Finally she turned herself in along with her so called boy friend. This rehab facility made her sign papers stating that if she was to relapse again she would be put into jail. I guess that scared her. She has been cleaned now for 4 years, has completed college and is now working full time in the drug and rehab facility that started her road to recovery. She is now a drug counselor helping others.

Since I was seventeen, trying to get sober was a constant theme in my life. I decided on my own it was time to take the iniciative to change my life, which I did. I went to rehab here in Monmouth county and lived in a sober house for about a year. I had a boyfriend who died from long term effects of herion when I was 23 and never dealt with it. Little did I know, my new death experiences would only increase as I began my recovery program. Its been two years and four months that I've been an active member of AA. On January 4th 2014, I found my closest friend dead in his apartment. Ryan was an amazing, caring, loving 22 year old with spunk,energy and a positive aura which lightened up anyone who crossed his path. Finding his body was and still is one of the hardest things I struggle with. Yes, I've had lots of death in my life but I was drinking those thoughts away in addition to surpassing them. I can't and won't do that when I think of the night I layed with the cold, still good looking body of one of my closet and only friends in New Jersey. I know if I were to pick up a drink over this traumatic even it would do nothing but make matters worse. During my dark times its crucial for me to think about how to was able to get through the even darker moment and years of that time in my life. It will be two years on January 4th, and the depression is sinking in. Every friday for a year, the event played in my head like a spinning film. You can do it!

Jennifer,29,Female,South River,Middlesex,I began using heroin when I was 18. I met a guy and one thing led to another and I began using with him. First smoking crack then snorting heroin. Then shooting up both heroin and cocaine. This lasted about two years. In those two years my relationship with my boyfriend began to become abusive. I left my home to live with him.  We were homeless for a long period of time.  I've slept in backyards on benches and in the woods. Then the in and out of jail began. For about a Year that's all it was. Until one day I got arrested again and decided to go away to a rehab program called dynamic youth community in upstate new york. I went there for almost 3 years.  Inpatient and outpatient. I eventually started school for substance abuse to earn my CASAC certificate in the state of New York.  Then I began working as an actual counselor in the rehab I was in. I completed my program after three years and then eventually moved back home to NJ. I have been clean off heroin cocaine and crack for almost 10 years. It will be 10 years in September 2014. I am now married own my own home and am expecting a baby any day. I am striving to open up my own rehab center to give back to addicts like myself.

Megan,22,Female,Middlesex,Middlesex,"I started using heroin when I was 19 and my first reaction when I was offered it was who even does herion? And as soon as I tried it I was instantly in love with how it made me feel. In high school I struggled with drinking too much and developed a cocaine addiction and was in my first rehab at 15. I never did pills before picking herion, I honestly didn't like how opiates made me feel. My herion addiction started off only on weekends and I was only sniffing it. On Thanksgiving i woke up extremely sick and thought I had the flu, later that night me and my boyfriend got heroin and all symptoms instantly went away. This is when I knew I had a problem, but it didn't stop me. The next 2 years I used everyday. My family didn't want to be around me and didn't trust me at all. I was living in a motel with my boyfriend and when I turned 21 me and him decided we needed help. I went to my own rehab and he went to his own. Going in I really wanted to stay clean and not use heroin ever again. Shortly after being in a 30 day rehab I was drinking all the time and snorting cocaine and molly. It didn't take long at all for me to start using heroin again. I lost my grandmother and I lost control. The Nevers I said I would never do happened . I was using a needle and using everyday. Then I was shooting heroin and molly everyday all day long. I ended up being caught at work and told I needed help, but I wasn't ready to get help yet. My boyfriend was being sentenced to jail and I was going to get help once he went away. I lived in a crack house with my boyfriend, I never had money for food so I lost a lot of weight. My family knew something was wrong because I never came around. I missed Christmas with my family which killed my mother. My nephew 3rd birthday party in Feb 2014 was where my family saw me after not seeing me for months. I showed up extremely high and extremely late. My twin sister was crushed and I only went there to manipulate her into giving me money. The next 2 weeks were hell, it wasn't fun anymore. My hole family didn't want me in their lives unless I got help. They gave me an intervention where they told me I had a bed in FLorida at a rehab. I said no and went back to my house with my boyfriend and layed there and asked myself what the hell are you doing, this is not the life you want! And i decided to go away. Feb 24th 2014, I went to Florida and I was determined to change my life. 2 weeks past and I wanted to leave because all I could think about was my boyfriend I left behind. I stuck it out and thank god I did because it changed my life, I found out underlying issues to why I was the way I was. Then I went to a halfway house and took every suggestion that was given to me. I am now 5 months clean and extremely greatful. I got a sponsor who I call everyday, I attend a NA meeting everyday and most of all I don't pick up. I never though my life would crumble to the bottom that it did. I hurt the closest people to me and didn't care about anyone. Everything I did was to get that next high. I was a terrible aunt to my two amazing nephews. Today I have my family back in my life who are proud of me. I'm a good daughter, sister, niece, and most of all I'm a better person. I never thought I could be happy, but today I am. My recovery comes before anything else in my life because if it doesn't it will take me back out. I know its not getting better out there and I never want the life I was living. I have my own apartment in FLorida with my best friend who I met in detox. I have an awesome support system down here. Bottom line you don't need to hit a bottom like everyone says, if you want this you can have it.  I still have bad days in recovery, but I don't pick up. I learned that I can have fun clean and aober which I never thought was possible. I'm not gunna preach like this is so easy and you'll be happy immediately because it doesn't work like that. This is the hardest thing I've done, and I still struggle with the thoughts and insanity in my head but I have people in my life to help me through it. As far as my relationship with the boyfriend who I used with and was with for 4 years, he is currently serving time in jail. Today I don't do everything I can to make everyone else happy, I work on me all day long. For new addicts who some advise I have is that if you think that by taking heroin out of the picture and that you can still drink please try it and let me know how it goes. Drinking took me right back out, I didn't do heroin right away but it didn't take long for me to have a needle in my arm like I never stopped. Don't stay with the same people you used with or the places, change is a big part in what keeps me clean. And if you don't think your an addict or you didn't hit your bottom because your not using a needle or you didn't use as much as someone else that's bull because everyones stories are different but we all share a common bond that our lives have became unmanageable, its when your sick and tired of literally being sick and tired. Get a sponsor and work the 12 steps. I promise that it is worth it to stick around because amazing things happen. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,

I say want because there are addicts who are not ready to get clean but get into a rehab only to sign themselves out.

At this present time my sister is a crack addict along with the pain killers/opiates. The last time I visited N.J. I went to Coopers deli on Orange street in Newark and witnessed some addicts walking down the street, they took the heroin and sniffed it dropped the paper it came in on the ground and kept walking as if that is normal.

Gail,60,Female,Pennsville,Salem,"i have 2 heroin addicted daughters. One homeless and living in a shelter and one that 10 days ago tried to kill herself because she saw no way out. Both have lost everything including their children. they cant stop using and they both have legal problems that become insurmountable to them . Not enough beds for treatment and the beds available are for short term only. Addicts need longer treatment to learn how to live without the drugs that they have used for so long to numb their pain, shame and guilt. My daughters have history of trauma that occured at young ages,family history of alcholism and and addictions that started with pills and very quickly evolved into IV drug use. They have stolen from friends family and from their kids to support their habits. They have sold and traded their bodies for drugs.and have done unspeakable other things. They have lost their souls. and i still love them and pray everyday that god holds them in the palm of his hand. Obtaining treatment should not be so hard. If they have lost everything how can they call drug treatment centers everyday and what number can a drug treatment center call them on. I say I love them and i do but they can no longer live with me. I was so sick of finding needles, dope packets and tourniquets. I have had my jewelry, checks,electronics clothng along with anything else moveable stolen or traded for drugs. they became rather quickly unrecognizable to me. Their search for ways to get drugs was an all day everyday job..They have overdosed ,gone through withdrawal and have put themselves in horrible situations all to get more drugs.

Kelly,51,Female,Howell/Jackson,Monmouth,"I believe the story of my family started out generations ago.......from great grandparents and grandparents who were ""only"" alcoholics to our own parents who had better access to prescription drugs to combine with their alcohol desires. Those parents then passed the desires down to their own children who now are exposed to their parents alcoholic behaviors and combine that with stealing their prescription drugs, selling them and then buying heroin, thus a new cycle begins.
It makes me sick!
My name is Kelly. I, recently, lost my oldest sister and her son to drug and alcohol accidental overdoses. They drink, take drugs and just never wake up. Yes, it can happen to you. They never knew it would be their last day on this earth and never cared that they were influencing and ruining the other people in their lives.
I have another sister who is currently going to die as well.
She is fully involved with alcohol, doctor prescribed prescription medication and heroin. Quite a deadly combination. 
She doesn't care about her family. She doesn't care that her 2 younger adult children have alcohol and drug problems. She doesn't care that her 2 older children want nothing to do with her and don't want her to see her 3 grandchildren for fear of their safety when they are with her. She thinks no one knows and she THINKS someone believes all her lies.
The addict thinks no one knows, but everyone knows Ronnie. Everyone knows!
My mother was the one in our immediate family that my sisters learned their habits from. So many tales of searching for her when she disappeared...showing her photo to strangers in Ocean Grove because she was supposedly there, being removed from our home by the county...sleeping with knives next to me to protect myself....How I escaped the addiction process I don't fully understand, but I do know that you are who you hang out with. I joined my local first aid squad, went to ACOA and CODA meetings because I knew I felt different and wanted to understand. I felt guilty being ""normal"", if there is such a word in an alcoholics family. No, not really but I developed other traits that were good from being in this family.  How was I so blessed with not having a problem? Thank you God! 
There are years of tales from a family that has to deal with substance abuse and they are basically all the same. We all just change the names or the towns in our stories. The bottom line is also the same...If the addict does not want to change or does not want help, then all the treatment in the world will never help.

Linda,57,Female,Swedesboro,Gloucester,"Our son, 36 has been addicted to opiates for 15/20 yrs. He denies he has a problem. We have found trash bags full of prescription bottles. He Dr. shops. One Dr prescribed 140 pills in just 2 wks. Our son also hurts himself on purpose or makes up pain to go to the doctors to get his pills. There are stacks and stacks of medical bills; unpaid. 
This past April, his wife decided to separate from him. His wife and 2 children were moving in with her parents and our son had no place to live. After many hrs of discussion, my husband and I decided to let him live with us short term. We lent him $ for a used car, he got a job, and we thought all was ok. We can tell when he is using. We saw the sliding backwards. We had saved up change for 4 yrs and 1 night noticed that all our change was gone, approx. $1500/$2000. We kicked him out. He denied stealing it, begged to let him move back in. Our answer was no. 
A couple wks later, our business van's window was broken into and rolls of electrical wire taken. Police were called and we saw a video tape of our son, selling our wire to a scrapyard. There is now a warrant out for his arrest. We have not heard from him since that happened. 
He has stolen his wife's debit card, taken $ from his kids piggy banks, sold the kids video gaming system, his cell phone. He is a liar, a thief, a manipulator, and he is very good at all of these. 
Unless he admits he is a drug addict, we now know there isn't anything we can do. We can only hope he gets the help he needs before he dies of his addiction. 
He has told us it would be our fault, when your son is dead. We called the police, one time when he texted us this, thinking that he would now get help. The police took him to the hospital, he was evaluated, blood work done. They knew by his blood work that he was using, but did not find any mental illness, and discharged him. Now, my question is, if a person is on so many antianxiety pills (5 to 6 at a time) plus opiates that he just passes out, how is he not a danger to others while driving? I don't get it. We have taken him to the emergency room, bc we could not wake him up, and when our son tells them he is in pain, they prescribe opiates. ??? Why, why when we tell them he is an addict? Besides our son, I also blame the doctors and the pharmacies. Why is there not a database for opiates. How can our son get 3,4,5 prescriptions in the same week from different doctors and different pharmacies? Damn, I can't even get blood pressure pills without specific authorizations! My BP pills cost 60.00, opiates cost $5.00! Why do doctors still use paper prescription pads? We had 1 bottle of OxyContin with 100 pills prescribed! Did he change the quantity? Or did the Dr prescribe that many? 
This is all a vicious cycle and until the drug companies, doctors and pharmacies do something, this widespread use of pain killer addiction will continue. ",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Patty,54,Female,Blackwood,Camden,"I lost my son to a heroin overdose. He struggled most of his adult life with substance abuse always trying to get into treatment but being turned away because we were told by his insurance carrier that he didn't meet the criteria and heroin withdrawal is not life threatening.  When we would get him into treatment the most he ever got was 8 days and would be release early.  June 2010 we finally got him in but had to lie and say he was abusing alcohol  they took him immediately but after 11 days was released, he asked for an extension but was denied.  We were told to go directly to Maryville with him but when we got there they said there were not beds  we were only able to get him IOP 3 nights a week from 6pm9pm  on his 90th day clean and sober he relapsed and died.

Cathy,62,Female,Cranford,Union,"My daughter had a baby 19, and she and my granddaughter continued to live with me. My daughter was a good mother, becoming a very responsible young adult, a good companion. She was hard working, had signed up for college, and contributing greatly to the household. We had plans to co purchase a home within a year.

A new boyfriend, and within six months my daughter was unemployed and homeless, living in her car until it was repossessed. Her behavior caused me to be kicked out of our rented apartment and when I moved I brought her daughter with me. Three years later my daughter is a prostitude, heroin addict, lost her daughter permanently to me as her guardian, been in jail numerous times, has warrants out, lost her health.  Oxycodone dealing rapidly turned to heroin. 

Now my granddaughter and I live week to week without child support, and day to day we do not know where Mom is, and go for months without hearing from her. We are not expecting a happy outcome. Fortunately, we qualify for free weekly counseling under a grant in Union County for grandparents raising grand kids. With this and the help of a wonderful school her child is striving. But the emotional impact is daily on both of us.  

I had to leave my job because it was too far away from home as I am now the sole caregiver. New jobs are very stressful, but at least my daughter doesn't know where I now work and thus cannot torment me on the phone at work constantly.  I have called the police on her enough times, and also with the knowledge of a constant warrant out for her arrest from not paying child support that she no longer tries to break in to our new home and does not look to me anymore as the easiest person to steal from.

On one of our trips to court the judge told her she would be ordered into rehab if she didn't go to NA.  The reality of that sentence was she spent 3 months in county jail, and when she got out I agreed to have dinner with her the first night out, upon which she came high to. That was the extent of her sentencing. ",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,

He graduated to doctor shopping and pharmacy hopping, and when that finally came to a halt, he turned to heroin 18 months ago, and in 6 months had a $200/day habit. He has now lost his marriage, home, and is now serving six months in jail for his 4th DUI.  he is only 36 years old and will spend his birthday, tomorrow in jail, but at least he is alive, and for the first time in almost 20 years, I know he is safe and clean at night...

He sold everything he owned, and some things he didn't to feed his habit, cash from my accounts, his wife's jewelry, etc.  To realize my money went to fund his, and his friends' habit, and I could have been responsible for a death is devastating to me.

He has been in rehab and 28 days is just not enough

Heroin in this part of hunterdon county is about $5/bag and easily available without day tripping to Newark. How horrible that I know that

I'm a retired township clerk and was always in fear that I would embarrass my town and my family.  I also always feared I would come home to find my son dead.  the feeling is absolute despair is always with me.

this is a terrible, insidious disease that most folks don't understand, law enforcement can make 20 arrests per day, per town, and there will be 20 more dealers to take over the territory.

Gretchen,32,Female,Southampton,Burlington,"No one says when I grow up I want to be a junkie strung out on heroin. Finding any way to get money so that I don't have to be sick by the afternoon. I've been addicted to heroin for well over 10 years with sobriety periods that ranged from a few months to over a year. I lost everything I was about to lose my family when it clicked that I don't want to be doing this anymore. I want my life back I want to be happy and healthy. I stole from my mom from work something I never thought I would do I did. I lost my job (actually happy about that) but I never lost my family. See in my house all three kids were heroin addicts. We were raised middle class had values were taught to hold the doors for others and all ways say please and thank you. We weren't street kids with parents that didn't care in fact they care to much at times never wanting to see us fall and that can hinder a drug addict. Let us fall let us get to the point were the options are death or jail and most likely you won't go to jail. See in Camden the cops don't go after the dealers they go after the buyers take the drugs and if they want to write you a ticket or take you to jail they will but 9 out of 10 times they just tell you to leave and take your drugs. See i didn't fit the mold of a drug addict so when I was pulled over by them they just let me go and so many times I wanted them to take me away so I could get help. I don't have health insurance so I can't afford to get help unless I am in legal trouble what bullshit is that. Last year my parents paid for my younger brother out of pocket to go to rehab only to get and use again. He is a habitual relapser going to a rehab getting out and using. My older brother his wife gave him an ultimatum get help or we get divorced even though they just got married. He has been clean from opiates for a few years now. My younger brother just went to another detox/ rehab last week. Will it work this time who knows it's his 8th or 9th time going and he is only 24 years old. For me I have been clean again for 3 weeks I left myself with no money no gas and stuck it out until I was able to see a suboxone therapist a week later. In the mean time I was sick as a dog but realized that this was it the last FUCKING TIME I SWEAR TO GOD I AM DONE. I want my family more then I want the drug. The cops in Camden need to grow some fucking balls and go after the dealers instead of the buyers. Ok so you may get 10 bags off of a person but the dealers are holding it in houses they buy on a street they set up for drug operations all ways having thousands of bags in those houses at any time. But no the cops are told not to bother with them in case they are holding guns. See down here the guys setting up the sets aren't getting kids to sell there drugs they are getting drug addicts to sell the drugs in exchange for a few bags and some money. Ok so they put cops on foot patrol in Camden but only on a few streets and doesn't matter people are still selling and now PCP is a big thing for the dealers themselves to use and other black people that live in Camden walk down. Mt. Ephriam Ave. and you will see people all over lighting up a cigarette laced with PCP with a cop standing right there. They rave about all the cops they have out in Camden doing foot patrol and making a difference but that's bull shit they go after the guppy instead of the shark. So drugs will all ways be  in Camden until they grow some balls and do something. My story is the same as everyone else's it started off with prescription drugs and ended with heroin. Will this be my last time ever using it again I don't know but all I can do is live one day at a time appreciate what life has to offer. Life really isn't that bad ok so I used so I didn't have to deal with life and the issues I have dealt with in my life but in the end life is far more better without drugs. So maybe this will be my last time I'm hoping and I pray everyday the urge to use has gone away but it can all ways come back its a life long issue. Now only they offered free help to people like me therapy and suboxon treatment but there is to much money to be made off of it plus most doctors don't go through the insurance companies. The hardest part about being an addict is watching your parents cry every day and night because all they want is to make you better and they can't. I hope all those that are struggling get better you just need to fight for your life back. There is more to my story but it's to long for this,",box,,User,User,syringe.svg,,
Jennifer,37,Female,Elizabeth/Summit,Union,"I will be celebrating 4 years clean from heroin on August 19th. I was 116 pounds and using on a daily basis when I found out I was 28 weeks pregnant. I was immediately put on a methadone program. I was also placed in an inpatient mommy and me program 3 weeks after finding out about my pregnancy. That program saved my life. I was angry and resistant to going, but I also knew that this was the end of my road and it was life or death. As soon as my daughter was born I began my detox from methadone. My baby was in the hospital 40 long days where doctors detoxed her with phenobarbital and morphine. She came home to me the day after Thanksgiving and I couldn't have been more scared. She was still not well; it took about a month to get her better. My detox took 8 months to get off methadone, a week of suboxone and another month  to feel myself again. One day at a time I walk this journey with a great support system. I never want to feel what I felt while I was using. And I put a child through something because of my doing. I have learned to forgive myself and be proud of who I am.  I am so grateful for the program of NA/AA. I was given a second chance. My daughter had early intervention at 8 months and showed no sign of delays. Today she  is 3 and is happy and healthy, and one would never know what she has been through in her first days of life. I continue to attend meetings regularly. I changed people, places and things. And most importantly I changed my thinking. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Gail,60,Female,Wharton,Morris,"My youngest daughter and her husband have been addicts for I don't know how long. Last year in May they got stopped for a broken tail light in Booton. They had their 15 month old son with them.  The officer wanted to know why she was acting so nervous.  She hates getting stopped by the police and has an anxiety disorder to begin with.  The officer told her if she cooperated, they would just ticket her for the tail light and let them go. She had heroin packets in her wallet.  I did know they were using heroin to self medicate for other reasons since neither have medical insurance and no doctors would help them without money.  DYFS was called to the station and both of her sons were taken away. Her 8 year old son was in school at the time and DYFS went and picked him up and took both of the kids to foster care. That was over a year ago and both of my grandsons are now with their uncle and aunt in Oklahoma.  I haven't held either boy since the left New Jersey.  DYFS wants my daughter and soninlaw to give up their parental rights of their sons. They have been trying to get into treatment centers that DYFS and the court has told them they need to attend but with no insurance or money, the treatment centers won't admit them.  My daughter and soninlaw are homeless and have been living out of my car.  I try to help them financially with what I can but it has put me in debt and a big strain on the rest of my family.

Jean,51,Female,Roxbury,Morris,"Heroin almost destroyed my family. Once her addiction took hold, we saw my sweet, beautiful, sensible, caring and intelligent daughter transform into this completely different person. She became a sickly, disheveled, lying, lazy stranger. She seemed to sleep most days away, slowly losing interest in everything she had previously cared about. She lost her job, quit school and was basically killing herself right in front of our eyes. Our fears and concern for her led to some very ugly family scenes. Our lack of understanding only helped to enable and eventually accelerate her downward spiral. My own life had become insane. My physical and emotional health began to rapidly deteriorate.

The real  turning point for us was the discovery that she had been systematically stealing from every member of our family including my elderly mom who had come to live with us. These events led to the beginning of her detox and rehab journey as well as my own recovery with the assistance of a local Naranon support group. The next six months were filled with insurance battles, attempts at outpatient (IOP) treatment, creation of healthy boundaries, relapses, a week of homelessness on the streets of NJ, a brief inpatient stay (which insurance would not cover), followed by PHP (partial hospitalization) and more IOP services. Finally, by January of 2013, it became obvious that if my daughter stayed home none of us would ever be well again. 

Through a recommendation she received from a counselor at her last IOP,  she was given the number of an outreach program called Steps to Recovery. With the help of this program she was placed in a rehab facility in Florida. This advocacy group negotiated with our insurance company and gained their reluctant approval. The rehab facility (Ocean Breeze Recovery) agreed to accept whatever our insurance would pay and scholarship the remaining cost of her stay. Over the course of the next year, she continued her battle with addiction having multiple relapses followed by quick returns to sobriety. Her last relapse almost caused her her life after shooting heroin laced with fentanyl. I can honestly say that I could not have survived all of this trauma without the support of my friends at Naranon.

At this time, my daughter is living in a three quarter sober house, working a fulltime job, and actively participating in a twelve step program with the help of her Sponsor. She recently celebrated six months of sobriety and is working hard to get her entire life back on track realizing that she has a lifelong battle ahead of her. I feel that a new and improved version of my ""real"" daughter has been returned to our family. At this time, I am truly hopeful for her future. However, I continue to attend my weekly support meetings understanding how fragile both of our recoveries are. 

With the help of my Naranon groups, and their literature, I have learned to ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____detach with love��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___, allowing my daughter to figure out her own life. I realized that all of my ""help"" had really just prolonged her disease and that by getting out of the way I have shown my daughter that I believe in her ability to manage her own life. I can honestly say that I have found serenity and gratitude as a result. My relationship with my addicted daughter is now based on mutual respect and understanding. With the support of my recovery program , I have gained a better perspective on my entire life and a true sense of compassion for those affected by the disease of addiction. There is help out there for everyone if they choose to seek it.",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,

Andrea,35,Female,Cranford,Union,"i started doing heroin at the age of 21. i had 2 wisdom teeth pulled out and i got a scrip for percocet. i was already a big partier, booze, cocaine on occasion, weed here and there. the percocet gave me a feeling i had never had before. i fell in love with that feeling. when i ran out of percocet, i decided to try heroin. i knew where to get it because i had copped coke a few times before. and then there went the spiral. i had to sell myself and commit crimes to maintain money for my habit, but i got locked up so many times in the county jail with charge after charge. every time i got out of jail, i would maybe stay clean like a week or two, but i always went back. one time i was in jail for only 10 days. i was just coming off being dopesick and i get on the bus to go home and this cute girl starts talking to me and actually gives me a bag of dope. i didnt know her from Adam, didnt even know she was a user. i had not a chance of staying clean that time. after some more in and out of jail and violating probation like 4 times, the judge sent me to prison in Clinton. i was there for a little over 2 years and i didnt use there but i didnt do anything to even try and recover from my disease. i was clean and crazy. when i got out, i had to go back to live with my mother and 2 brothers (i had lived elsewhere before this prison stint) and i had a very hard time coping with life at home, so i was using again within a month of being home. my mother was gonna kick me out and i had literally no where to go. NJ doesnt allow people with a felony of distribution on their record to even stay in a homeless shelter. so i went for out patient treatment, and slowly began to learn about my disease and get clean. not without some bumps in the road. i put the heroin down but i couldnt seem to get it through my head that an addict like me cant drink! so i had my alcohol stumbles throughout. i started the outpatient treatment in 2009, and i have not picked up heroin since. i am currently over two years completely clean, and i maintain my recovery meetings, have a sponsor, work steps and am also in service to the fellowship.

Jenny,35,Female,Cranford,Union,"My husband is a recovering opiate addict, however I know that every day  is a struggle for him.  My brother is currently in inpatient rehab for opiates and my younger sister is an opiate addict as well. I've called the doctors begging for them to stop writing prescriptions for them because they are addicts, but my pleas fall on deaf ears. It wouldn't really matter though, because they can buy them very easily on the street, however, they are expensive ($10$20 for one pill). If they do have to buy them, they usually lie or steal to get the money. Some have made the switch to heroin because it is so much cheaper. Everyday is so difficult for me because I am watching people I love the most suffering and there is nothing I can do for them and no one will listen. Every time the phone rings, I'm afraid one of them has overdosed. Opiates and heroin are everywhere, people don't even realize how bad it is. I've gone to the police with information and begged them to do more.  Unfortunately it has become so difficult for me, that I am considering moving out of state to get away from it all.  I am seeing so much heartache that I usually cry myself to sleep at night. I worry about my father having to worry about this and I worry about my loved ones who are all addicts.

C,33,Female,Wayne,Bergen,"I have been struggling with heroin addiction for many years now. it is a vicious cycle that I would like to finally break.  however, access to QUALITY TREATMENT is few and far between.  I don't have money or insurance, so if I do get accepted to a treatment center, its funded by a state grant, and its only for a short period of time, usually just detox.  Optimally I would love to go to Florida to one of those fancy treatment centers, some friends of mine were lucky enough to afford them, and have been clean for years since.  Every time I went to treatment it was just for detox, and by the time you leave detox after a week, you still feel like crap cause now you are suffering with Suboxone withdrawals, which are just as bad as heroin withdrawals, so the vicious cycle begins again.  Im sick and tired of being sick and tired, I just want my life back.  I never wanted to be an addict. I don't want to be anymore either.  The current waiting list for treatment is ridiculous.

Alba,51,Female,Colts Neck,Monmouth,"
My son, Nick was a fun loving, daring, gentle, and kind kid, who loved life, NJ, his family and friends.  He was your typical boy next door.  As a kid he played little league, was in the boy scouts, PopWarner, did recreational basketball and baseball.  He was part of the football team at Colts Neck High School.  He shared his father��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s love for the Yankees, Giants, and the Knicks.  He was bright with a gift for writing.  

Then one day Nick��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s love of adventure and curiosity led him in the wrong path.  He tried painkillers while a sophomore in high school.  He thought he could control it; that he was only taking it for fun.  But soon, the pills were controlling him. He had become an addict.  When pills were not enough and got too expensive to maintain, he graduated to heroin and later to heroin mixed with cocaine (speedball).  We did not find out about his painkiller addiction until December 7, 2010, when he broke down and admitted to his father that he had a problem.  That would be the first of 6 stints at drug rehab centers in the space of 3 years.

After his last rehab stay, Nick moved to a sober living facility in Trenton, NJ.  This was very different from where he grew up in rural Colts Neck.  He had lost his job, his car and had received a 5year probation for a crime committed to support his heroin habit.  The experience humbled him.  He was getting in touch with his spiritual side and was seeking God.  We all believed he had finally hit bottom and would now start getting up.  He was making a lot of progress.  In hindsight, too much progress in too short a time.  He found a job at a local gym as a membership consultant, where he quickly made sales quota.  He was able to finance a used car and was offered the position of house manager at the new sober living house he was moving to which is owned by the same owner of the house in Trenton.  This was to take place on the first week of February.

All these responsibilities at once for someone who was only 3 months into recovery was too much for him to handle.  He felt pressured.  According to texts found on his phone, sometime around February 4 or 5 he relapsed.  On February 11 he was evicted from the sober living house for using drugs.  On that day, he asked if he could spend the night at my house.  He did not tell me that he had been evicted or that he had relapsed.  His reason for spending the night was that my house was closer to his job than his new house in Lambertville.  When he came over we discussed his new endeavors and he told me that he had decided not to take the manager��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s job at the house as he felt it was too much too handle.  Probably the only truth he told that night, ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____that it was too much to handle.��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___  He kissed me good night, told me he loved me and went to bed.  The next morning my son was dead from an apparent heroin overdose (as of this writing, I have not received a toxicology report��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��_____a needle and a baggie were found near his body).  

That same day of my son��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s death, I went to the sober living house where he had been staying to get answers.   I wanted to know why I was not informed that my son had been evicted.  Why no one had been called:  not his probation officer, not the man from Christian Life Prison and Recovery Ministry who had paid his first month��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s rent, nor me.  The answer I received left me flabbergasted.  I was told that my son was a grown man and had made his own decisions.  

I then realized that the system is broken.  These kids are left to fend for themselves and deal with a problem that is beyond their capabilities to handle.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, addiction is ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain; they change its structure and how it works. These brain changes can be long lasting and can lead to many harmful, often selfdestructive, behaviors...The chronic nature of the disease means that relapsing to drug abuse is not only possible but also likely.""  Therefore, how can he then be held to his decision not to go rehab, if his brain is damaged and not capable of making logical, sensical decisions.

NJ needs a Substance Abuse Intervention Law that will allow parents, relatives and/or friends to petition the court for treatment on behalf of the person who is substance abuse impaired.  This law exists in Kentucky, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Massachusetts and is being considered in Indiana. Denial and distorted thinking impedes and addict to make rational decisions. A heroin addict is only a needle away from death.  This disease is a progressive, lifethreatening disease. The best hope of survival for a person who is substance abuse impaired is intervention. 

Studies show that involuntary treatment has the same success rate as voluntary treatment. In fact, many recovering addicts who are living a drugfree life today rare doing so thanks to a courtordered treatment they received after having been arrested for a crime while under the influence of a substance. More often than not, drugs and crime go hand in hand since many addicts resort to crime to support their addiction. Courtordered treatment has been proven to be effective regardless of who initiates it.

Had this law been in place in NJ, the sober living house manager where Nick was living would have been compelled to use it on my son and he would be alive today.  Drug addiction is a hard disease to beat, but not an impossible disease to beat.  There are countless of success stories of people who suffer from a substance abuse disorder who are now living a drugfree life.  Many had relapsed numerous times.  For some it only takes one visit to a rehab center.  For others it may take countless visits.  But as long as they are alive, there��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s always hope that the next time in rehab will be the time they get it.

I was born and raised in Madison, NJ and had an awesome childhood.  I have 2 amazing parents, I just hung around the wrong people.  My addiction took me to the streets of Newark, where I lived from age 18 to 28.  I have been to 17 rehabs that cost my parents tons of money.  None of them worked.  I was incarcerated many times, and went to prison in 2004. I overdosed multiple times.   In 2009, I almost lost my life.

Shannon,26,Female,Rockaway Twsp,Morris,"I began using drugs at a young age. When I entered my freshman year at highschool I had already dabbled in various drugs, from pot to heroin. By the middle of my highschool career I was living s double life. Playing the role of a student, daughter, friend. Deep down I was seriously conflicted and injecting heroin in secrecy. I became totally removed from all activities school related. All of my ""friends"" were now those that shared our mutual Interest; heroin. Daily trips to areas such as east orange, Newark, Paterson became nothing of the norm. Reality was a white well respected family and parents were my background and I had no other reason than to fuel my addiction. So this lasted throughout highschool , junior year was my first impatient program. From 1619 I had been in 5 inpatient rehabs, two private 3 state facilities. I became even more angry and frustrated and upon my release each time was not ready or could find the desire to stop using as they say. It wasn't until I lost all connections with my family and true friends, being homeless and stealing to support my raving habit. I went to jail and I guess that was the beggining of the end.I was being tried as an adult having  graduated passed my juvinlle convictions. I was facing prison time and multiple felony offense s due to my out of control lifestyle. With the guiding support of my family I was given one final chance to pull it together. My loving father who is also a recovering alcoholic, put up my bail money and I returned to the house I grew up in being away for 2.5 years. Not before I was sentenced my codefendant, who was also my boyfriend and best friend for 5 years agreed to take drug court as his plee. He was staying in a three quarter house in his hometown, in my opinion a terrible place to return. Unless you give it your 110% people places and things are what bring you back. Just before I was sentenced on Feb 8 2008 Louis Petrocco died. He attended drug court earlier that day and had what he called ""a 4 day window "" where he felt he could use on Thursday and attend probation Monday to look clean. He didn't make it and was found Friday morning by a family friend. He was 23 years old. I have lost many people to this terrible disease over the years. It is a vicious and terrible cycle to break. Luckily I am one of the miracles. After his death I remained sober for an entire 4 years. I relocated to California and I'm blessed with a beautiful, restored life. I have not done opiates since 2008, and I know it does not justify because in the program they say ""a drug is a drug is a drug"". However I disagree. I believe heroin and opiates are the worst of them. Physically controlling and slowly killing so many people. I am a California resident and do have a 215 card. I prefer this than my prescription of xanax doctors prescribed for my social anxiety. Either way I am able to say I survived the grief, hell, pain and ultimately life taking abuse of heroin. I thank god and am grateful to be a survivor and Stive on. Yes there are not enough treatment centers in nj. Yes there should be some more awareness thought to the youth about addiction. I hope my expierence can help bring hope or understanding g to the rising epidemic at large.

His addiction started like many others. After a tragic car accident he had been prescribed opiates to manage his pain. When one wasn't enough he took two, then three, then more before finally resorting to heroin to keep his high alive. Looking back I see that my innocence shielded me from the truth and the signs of addiction. He had been released from rehab just 6 weeks prior and he passed away exactly 2 weeks after my 13th birthday which I was lucky enough to spend with him.

His last stay in rehab was a week before his death, where he checked out himself and was later found that week overdosing on a bad watch. It has sent my entire family into a depression and life will never be the same",box,,Sibling,Family,family.svg,,
Laureen,47,Female,Pt. Pleasant,Ocean,"My 36 year old brother had been struggling with heroin addiction for many years. His addiction was so powerful that he stole money from our dying mother without any remorse, and could only focus on his next high. He became homeless, and when I took him in, he couldn't hold a job and continued to abuse drugs. He was in and out of various rehab facilities, hospitals and homeless shelters.  He became a father and tried very hard to beat his addiction, but when life got rough, heroin always won. In May of 2013, I got the call I always knew would come thru eventually. My brother was found dead of a heroin overdose in his apartment. He died alone, at age 36, struggling every day to beat his addiction. He has a young son who will forever miss his father, and a sister who loved him dearly. ",box,,Sibling,Family,family.svg,,

Joe,27,Male,Roselle Park,Union,"My name is Joe Mazza. I'm 27 years old and I am from Roselle Park NJ. My story begins like a lot of other stories I have heard over the years. I am an avid weight lifter. I have been working out in the gym since I was 13 years old. 3 years ago I suffered an injury while working out. I tore 3/4 of my pectoral muscle off of my shoulder. Being in so much pain, I didn't know what to do. My mother took me to her doctor, which was a pain management doctor. The first day I walked in the door of that doctors office I was prescribed 10mg Percocet to take once a day for pain. The thing is, my addiction didn't really start here at pain management. It started in my mothers bedroom. 6 years ago my mother was involved in a car accident and hurt her neck. She was prescribed 10mg of Percocet twice a day for pain at the time from the same doctor I eventually went to. I really don't know what made me do it, but I found her pill bottle just sitting on her nightstand and I knew what Percocet was but I rarely ever had it. That day is where my addiction started and the fight for my life began. I took 2 10mg Percocets and laid in bed, ironically watching Intervention on A&E. 10 minutes go by and I feel like I'm floating on a cloud. I can't describe how good I felt in words. Oddly enough at that point in time my life didn't spiral out of control. I still held a job and a normal life thinking I am just using this drug recreationally.. What's the harm right? Well after spending time in physical therapy and being prescribed more and more Percocet from pain management a month, at the age of 24 years old I was a full blown opiate addict. I found myself taking up to 300mg of oxycodone a day. I was even hospitalized because I almost overdosed. That was when it hit me. I needed to do something about this and gain control of my life. To be honest I can explain ALOT more about my drug problem and how it has affected my life, but there isn't enough space here for me to even begin typing it. I would love to share my story with you in hope that someone else can possibly benefit from hearing it and how I got clean. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my story with you and hopefully I will hear from you soon.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Laurie,35,Female,Piscataway ,Middlesex,"This terrible drug has ripped apart part of my family. My cousin was in an accident which left him addicted to prescription drugs which led to his use of heroin. It has caused his parents to doubt all their instincts and ability to parent their other children, who have also had every aspect of their lives torn apart. The first rehab that he went to let him sign himself out only to return to another one after a few more run ins with local police. He could have seriously hurt or killed someone in that time driving under the influence. I thank god for his parents sake that that did not occur. The guilt they live with is unbearable and tearing them apart. It is so hard to find good care for not only the addicted but also to help heal the wounds from the shrapnel that obliterates families caused by this crisis. Its hard to have hope when so many have not survived this. What is a parent to do when one day they have a son with their whole lives ahead of them, and the next day they are facing kicking him out, cutting him off, and breaking ties to the son they love. This epidemic cuts across all financial backgrounds and all areas in new jersey. We need to start talking to our kids. They are only children, and so much more immature than generations before them. They have no idea how the decision to use heroin will lead them to not being able to make any more decisions ever. As a counselor I see kids everyday and see how poor their decision making skills are, and I see more parents trusting these decisions.  When the biggest decision they have had to make thus far is what jeans to wear, high schoolers and even college kids are less able to make the types of decisions they are allowed to make. I wish I was less strict said no parent ever. This is not me blaming parents but more society as a whole. We need to talk to young people and let them know its okay to say no, okay to have respect for their bodies, okay to talk about how scary this is for everyone. ",box,,Family,Family,family.svg,,

They went their way and I went mine. I chose a different life and I am so thankful I made that choice.  I watched my sister have a child. That child was taken away by the state. The sorrow lead her even deeper into her addiction. I watch my brother struggle, homeless, pan handling. I can't imagine what that life is like. I will never understand the choices that lead to this addiction and now that it has its hold on my siblings...it won't let go. I wish I could have my brother and my sister back. I am afraid that heroin will win. I think about them every day. I wish there was something I could do. It is so hard living with a loved one who is an addict but it is harder being the addict.

Stephen,29,Male,Toms River,Ocean,I am a former heroin ardict/high level dealer that is 4 years currently 29 years old and working in drug counseling.  I was an all state xc runner at Toms River hs north.  I was a state champion runner for Mathew Jelley and in was featured in the app for athletic accompishments on a weekly basis.  I graduated top 10% of my class in 2003. With a running/academic scholarship and never have touched a drug or alcohol in 2003 I could have went to any college I wanted. My family convinced me to stay in TR work atbthe family real estate agency and go to OCC. This was where it all started to spiral. All my friends moved on to college and I was lleft tonbe around those who didnt go to school right at the beginning of the opiod epidemic. By 2004 I was smoking weed.  By 2005 I was selling 24 poundsbof marijuana every other day. Thats when in 2006 I was introduced to roxicodone.  Upon tryint it I knew i was in trouble.  By 2007 I was using in upwards of 20 roxy 30s (blues at 25 a piece) daily.  Between 2007 and 2009 I spent over 2 million dollars on my habbit. I robbed pillaged aold myself on the internet as well as my gf at the time.  I was moving nearly 500 blues daily for years.  Every cop in town new my name and followed me every where I went.  But they knew they were dealing with a highly educated xc runner....a tough guy to catch.  I never got arrested. In 2010 i found heroin and even though i was terrified of needlea i tried it.  Of course within a month I was doing 30 to 50 bags of pure heroin on top of 4 xanax bars a day.  I was a monster.  I would have killed my mother for my next hit.  My family at the time went from rich to homeless and my life was a brutal existence. Cutting pure ounces of heroin outbof dead imported chickens in port Newark and bagging it and selling it in tr on the daily.  I was a monster in my own body.  I didnt know myself.   After an overdose that could have caused me some problems ( ill comment more to a reporter I trust) I decidee one morning omg what a become. The law was closing in I thought I had aids and hep (which through grace of god I didn't) because of sharing dirty needles and selling myself to gay men (I am straight now have a beautiful wife and newborn) and It was now or never.  I got on a bus sept 2011 to Florida and never looked back. Immediately started at a methadone clinic and have never touched a drug since that day. THat may sound intense cto you but in truth its a 1% small summaryof my ride from heaven to hell and baback that I am able to qquickly type on a small smartphone  The real story seems something outbof Hollywood and that would kill 99% of anyone whovdid it.  I was considered the worst of the worst in tr in2010 and was at the beginning of the epidemic.  I know how itbstarted and I believe I could stop it.  I've contacted trpd to become an informant only to no call back multiple times.  It seems they dont care. They know who I am and how valuable id be.  I want nothing more to use my experience to save one just one life. I believe with my unique survival story as well as my college education (oh and beating stage 3 lymphoma whilebeing an addict) that id be the perfect peraon to speak educate and save lives. ONLY a former  fiend can save an addict. They wont listen to ajyone who doea not know the game and who wasbt onxe respected as running it.  I want nothing more in life than to save someone else from the pain I ezperienced.

Toni,58,Female,Hammonton,Atlantic,"My daughter is a heroin addict.  she has overdosed at least twice.  She has been through rehab, both inpatient and outpatient, only to return to her unhealthy lifestyle.  She has 3 children, who were quite young when she first started this lifestyle.  I have had to take custody of them on more than one occasion.  I am widowed, am not getting any younger, have fibromyalgia and care for my handicapped father 24/7.  I also work part time.  My daughter continues to put her emphasis on what she can shoot in her arm rather than her children.  She has stolen from me, in amounts you can't even begin to calculate.  Desperation has even led her to steal the copper out of my air conditioning unit to get a fix.  Our neighbors despise us to the point that I, as the homeowner, receive threatening phone calls in the middle of the night from these irate neighbors.  Nothing reaches my daughter.  I try to help when I can, but do not ""enable"" (a term I loathe because persons that use it have no clue since they do not have an afflicted family member).  I think the general public is very uneducated that this is a DISEASE.  A form of mental illness, it varies from physical illness in two ways:  1)  you can't ""see"" the illness; and 2) it makes their actions absolutely despicable.    I am of the firm belief that way more emphasis needs to be placed on finding cures, or at least an alternative treatment, for mental illness.  ""Help"" for family members comes in the form of Family Service who has no clue what you really need.  I need someone to clean the house and run the children places.  I don't need them to be brought to the dentist at least twice a year.  Of course, I'm not minimizing dental hygiene, but these services need to really formulate what a sickly, elderly grandmother really needs to take custody of her grandchildren in the face of drug addiction on behalf of the parent.  The general public needs to realize this is a true sickness and stop judging harshly!  I am an educated, upper middle class woman and trust me, this type of horror does occur on this level.  I could happen to anyone!  And it is a nightmare.  ",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,

Rp (Cannot Disclose Full Name),25,Male,Bergen Co.,Bergen,"I began using opiates when I was 19 years old. My first experiment was with my cousin taking Oxycontin pills. When that became too expensive we searched for alternatives, and after research we discovered Heroin. We began to sniff Heroin infrequently, and the frequency began to build over time until it was multiple times a week. It started to become a slight burden financially, but I was still able to hide it from my family.  When I was 22 I discovered the method of injection through my same cousin, and that became my preferred method of ingestion. After I graduated college (Bachelors degree), it all went downhill. For the next 6 months the needle became my closest friend, and my greatest enemy.  It began to spiral out of control when I first ran out of money and became extremely sick. The sickness stuns you initially, because no one tells you the consequences of daily use. I fell into sickness without even knowing what was happening. My bank account was at $0, my credit cards were maxed out, and I began to steal from my job. This lasted a few months until I was caught, and subsequently fired.  I lied to everyone and anyone about what had happened, because no one would have ever suspected the kid who maintained excellent grades, a college graduate with perfect credit, a steady job, and payments on a brand new car would ever be experimenting with drugs and stealing from his job. This journey took me to being arrested and charged with DUI in Paterson, when I pulled to the side of the road because I began to fall asleep behind the wheel. I shutter to think about what would have happened if I fell asleep while I was driving and couldn't park my car in time. I could be facing vehicular manslaughter if I had hit someone. I awoke to an officer at my window because someone had called the police because someone was sleeping in a running vehicle. He conducted a field sobriety test and subsequently charged me with DUI. This didn't even stop me. I began to steal from my family members. Tablets, Ipods, jewelry, it was all fair game. A forged check along with the missing items was enough for my mother to finally make me answer the tough questions. I had to tell her I was addicted, and had no solutions to my problem. I desperately needed help. It was the single worst day of my life.  I was checked into a detox, followed by a rehab stint.  Upon release I continued to use on and off for another 7 months, until I decided enough was enough, and I was either going to Jail or going to die if I didn't stop this dangerous behavior. The one thing that made me stop was the hurt I saw on my mothers face. I could tell she wasn't looking at me like her son anymore, I had become a monster. The near overdosing, almost crashing my car, being charged with DUI, being fired from my job, none of that made me stop. The sheer look of sadness and anguish on my mothers face was what I needed to see, and it has forever kept me away from opiates. I conquered it, and I am currently doing great. I am back to being a productive member of society. I currently work 50 hours a week, haven't missed a day of work or used Heroin in 16 months. I have saved a ton of money and I'm back to practicing excellent financial habits. I also am back to maintaining a healthy lifestyle (diet, gym membership). I am back to being who I was preaddiction, and I couldn't be happier. I want my story to be an inspiration to those out there currently suffering from what I went through, and I want them to know there IS a way out. I've seen how dark and hopeless opiate addiction can be, but I've also seen the rewards of persistence against this disease and how giving it a fighting chance can save one's life. I am forever grateful to my family and friends, who stuck by my side through thick and thin. Without them, I would surely be dead.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
David,47,Male,Boonton,Morris,"I was introduced to pain killers after I turned 40. Owning my own pizzeria for over 15 years, I was given a Percocet for back pain. I was nervous about taking any medication. I decided to take half of the pill. The effect on me was total awe. In my mind, I thought the president should give this to everyone in the country!

Monique,47,Female,Woodbridge,Middlesex,"Heroin has changed my life and me forever. I was a single mom raising a daughter on my own both financially and emotionally. Her father was in the picture sometimes however, an alcoholic. Me and my daughter were close since we didn't have much family. In high school she had a few operations and was diagnosed with ovarian cysts she was also becoming rebellious and hanging out with the party crowd. I was a strict and loving but at times it was just hard to handle. She moved in with her dad around 19 and I moved away and that is when my life changed. I found out she had been using opiates for a while and now using heroin. I detoxed the first time alone fighting w her while she told me she was never going to stop using and that she didn't care if she lived or died. After 3 weeks she was my daughter again. That lasted a few months and she was hanging out with a bad crowd and back using. I was in Florida at the time and flew her down, when she got off the plane I was just do happy and relieved to have her with me but could see she just didn't care about herself and she was high, she passed out the whole ride while I wept while driving. She and I did it alone again, she didn't want to go anywhere and had gotten suboxone from a doctor. She got sober and wanted to ho back. I fought it hard but she got the ticket and I couldn't stop her. Once home she got into a relationship w a 41 yr olld controlling alcoholic. I was again depressed and knew she deserved better but could not convince her. A few months passed and she fell off the wagon and once again she came to my house and I begged her to get help and dropped her off at a so called friends house but not convinced I waited outside and she came back out and confirmed she was going to the hotel to shoot up. I held on to her arm with every fiber of my being g and begged and screamed and punched the car but I couldn't change her mind I knew at that moment no matter what I did she was going to do what she needed to get high. I didn't move I watched her walk away as I broke down hysterically crying watching my baby, my beautiful daughter walk away from my love into the arms of the devil. I  was changed as a person, it was finally my break point. She got sober again only to try and leave her controlling boyfriend for him to beat her so bad he broke her nose and put her in the emergency room. Walking into the hospital not knowing what I would find and seeing her all bloody and swollen once agaiin took a piece of me. She met a great guy who I cared for recently but was back to no good and is currently sober and in outpatient treatment and back with the abuser.

Candace,27,Female,Williamstown,Gloucester,"I am a former heroin addict. I was born and raised in a great family in a nice house with everything I could ever dream of.. Then I met a boy.. He was from Washington Twp (Sewell) and was older. I had just started my first job, answering the phones at a pizza place and was 15. I slipped and fell one day, injuring myself and the hospital prescribed me Percocet. I didn't have insurance and couldn't afford to fill it. The boy, just happened to have some.. Little did I know where that was going to lead me. First I just took one orally. Then one day, weeks later (I had formed a habit and didn't even realize or understand it) there were no more left. The boy came to me with this powder. Told me it was just a crushed Percocet and that it did the same thing and wouldn't hurt me. He insisted it was safe and reminded me over and over that I was injured and needed it. That was the first day of the worse chapter in my life. I snorted that powder not knowing that I would end up with a 6 year life threatening addiction to heroin. That day, after I snorted that weird smelling, funny brown powder, I felt insane. I knew almost instantly that it wasn't what he said. I threw up, I cried, but for some reason I liked it. I didn't dare ask him about it, I had previously seen how angry he could get and was afraid. The next day I did it again and again. I lost my job, I dropped out of high school, I moved in with the boy. One day his friend came by when he wasn't home and asked if we needed anything from Camden, since he was already going. I laughed and said ""what the hell could we possibly need from Camden?"" That is when I really realized I was addicted to heroin. The friend laughed as well and said ""your joking right? Don't you do dope with him?"" I informed him that I only took Percocet and that it was for pain and he informed me that I was so dumb and since when did Percocet come in a blue was paper Baggie? I confronted the boy only to be hit with the truth. That I was in fact doing heroin. I packed up and went home to my dad and brother, then the withdraw kicked in. I literally felt like I was going to die. I was hurting I was scared and I was alone. I didn't want to ask my family for help because my pride wouldn't allow me to let them down. I went back to the boy, got a fix, cried some more and realized that I was never going to amount to anything and I gave up on myself. In the years to follow I started using IV. I was in and out of jail, and hospitals due to stealing and overdoses. I died once and my family finally found out was going on. They fought for me, they put me in rehab over and over and it just didn't work. I stole from them, from strangers, from stores and just kept getting deeper and deeper into my addiction. I did things I swore I would never do just to get that next bag. I was held at gunpoint in Camden twice. I got caught at a dope set in Camden by a SWAT team and still that wasn't enough to scare me away. The heroin had a hold of me. I was pale, malnourished, underweight, and depressed. I was mentally, psychically, and sexually abused on a daily basis til one day I decided that I had had enough. One of my trips to rehab I had met someone from NA that lived in Allentown, PA. I called them and begged for help. Another member of NA from nj drove me out there where I detoxed on the woman's couch. It was horrible. I was so so sick I couldn't get up for days. But I had had enough and I wasn't going to give in. I stuck it out and to this day I am still clean. The day I decided to change was April 10th 2007. Seven years. Seven years I have been clean! I thank god every single day for giving me the courage and strength to get clean. Since getting clean I have worked the steps of NA, I have given my story at a podium in front of thousands of people at an NA convention in PA, NJ, and FL. I volunteered at rehabs and I got my life back. Today, I am married with two beautiful little girls and two college degrees. I am one in a million and I am proud. I'm not ashamed to tell people what I have been through because it made me the woman I am today.

Scott,40,Male,Jersey City,Hudson,"I am born and raised in Jersey City. It was around 1989 the first time I tried Heroin. I couldn't have been more than 15 years old. At the time, the city was infested with Heroin in all areas of the city. Not more than 6 months later I was hooked and using daily. Despite my addiction, I was able to graduate from High School. But once I was out of school I turned completely to a life a crime as my addiction progressed. I soon found myself in and out of jail and caught up in this vicious cycle for many years. In the end I was an IV user, homeless and hating myself. At the age of 27 I felt that my life was over and there was no reason to live. But somehow I was able to ask for help and I ended up going into a drug treatment facility and spent a little over a year there. I became involved in Narcotics Anonymous which ultimately saved my life. I went to school and became a drug counselor myself and spent the next decade working with the opioid dependent population in The South Bronx and Yonkers.

Where do I begin? I��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___m from a small town in Jersey and drugs were always accessible.

When I was 17 someone very close to me passed away from heroine/opiate overdose. My life has never been the same. Perhaps I wasn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t prepared to cope with such tragedy and depression but I don��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t know if anyone is. I��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___m not sure how I went from coping with a loss to abusing drugs myself but it wasn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t long before I was trapped by addiction. The very thing that stole a loved one my family was now killing me slowly. I dropped out of college, I isolated myself from my family and friends, I was no longer the smiling child with the world at his hands. I was just another deadbeat drug addict with every excuse in the world��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��_____but I couldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t stop.

There was nothing more I wanted than to be clean and a productive member of society. I thought I was doomed to overdose or find myself behind bars. I was drowning in a pool of my own misery with my family reaching their hands out to grab me but I couldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t find the strength to grab back. 
        If there��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s one thing I want readers with kids to take away from this is to never give up. Please, don��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t give up on your kids if they��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___re trapped in addiction. They don��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t want what they have. Despite all my wrongdoing my family was there for me whenever I needed them��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��_____.even when I was just a dead beat drug addict. My family and girlfriend never gave up on me even when I couldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t look at myself in the mirror. If it weren��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t for them, I may not of found the courage to come home after a binge and cry in their arms.

I went to my mom in tears and screamed for help. The next day I was in a rehab facility on my way to recovery��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��_____only it wasn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t that easy. I would go on to relapse countless times and morphed back into a hopeless statistic of relapse. 
        After several failed attempts and multiple visits to drug rehab institutions something finally clicked. I don��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t know what it was but I can tell you the support and love from those who never gave up on me was possibly the only life left in me.
         But a short time ago I lost another loved one to the vice of addiction. My roommate from rehab lost the battle and died from a heroine overdose. He was a special soul who helped me get clean. See, when you��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___re struggling to get clean, as a college kid the hardest part is reentering society. Peerpressure is all around you, you��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___ve forgot how to have fun without substances. I found strength and support in this friend; we were in this together. When I was informed of his passing, I was overwhelmed with pain immediately breaking down. A part of me died that day.
I understand the stigma with those struggling from addiction. There was a time when I shared the same ideology. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion but this isn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t a problem that��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s going away. We have countless neighbors, friends, and family members struggling in New Jersey.

Addressing the heroine and addiction epidemic has no clear answers but its perception is clogged with misconceptions and ignorance. 
Heroine and pills ripped my life apart and stole people from my life and I commemorated their lives with my own path of destruction and addiction. But if it were not for the loved ones and strangers that stood by my side I wouldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t be here today. And today I��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___m a collegegraduate with a fulltime job and I successfully ran for public office. I��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___ve been terrified and ashamed to share my story until I came across this project the StarLedger is putting together. I am tired of hiding; I want those struggling with heroine and drug addiction to keep fighting. There is a life after addiction.

Tina,27,Female,West Milford,Passaic,"I started using herion at the age of 17. I grew up in a town that didn't have much to do and my mother growing up was an alcoholic. I learned at a young age how to escape reality. My older sister growing up was always the prettier one and I used to get called ugly for a good part of my life and when your young that really really hurts. I never had boy friends and I thought there was something wrong with me. I started cutting myself at the age of  12   k I say that was my first drug. Then a year later I started smoking weed and drinking.  It made me feel cool and that know one could hurt me and that was my biggest fear was being hurt, not physically but mentally.  After awhile I just became depressed and I started day dreaming about killing myself and writing suicide letters and I would save them just in case it got that bad. So that one day came after years of experimenting with with other drugs trying to find that miracle drug that would numb every feeling of fear and insecurity in me. I never thought in a million years it would be ""herion"". I always knew in the back of my mind if I could get it I would try it. My so called friend who was an older boy brought me to Paterson N.J. to get some coke one night and asked me if I wanted to try ""what he does"". I didn't even ask what it was I didn't care what it was, anything that would help me come down from the coke sounded good to me. From then on when we would go it was no more coke it was "" what he did"". It was like we couldn't say the word cause it was a horrible dirty word at least I knew it was a bad word. In the beginning I was on the top of the world and that fear and insecurity left me anytime I sniffed a bump. I hid for a long time in till stuff in my house came up missing. I would take anything my so called friend told me was worth any value. I ended up dropping out of school after a friend's suicide. After that my addition took off and it landed me in psych wourds then my first rehab. I felt dope sick for the first time in my life at 17 but I know that now but back then I just thought I felt weird I had no idea what or how I was feeling I just knew I was severely depressed and wanted to die. I got out after 30 long days. From then on it was the same thing the pysc wourds and rehabs were a revolving doors. The longest I could stay clean was 30 days when I was away somewhere. Paterson was so close it was hard not to go back. My depression got to a point where I hung a belt in my back yard and I would get high on herion on just stair at it wishing I had the guts to just get it over with. I put myself in horrible neighborhoods that a skinny white girl doesn't belong I would hang out with people I had no business hanging out with I looked and felt like the walking dead.  I didn't want to get clean cause I knew what I would have to do and that was get away from everything and everyone I know. I thank God I never had to sell my body for drugs but I did sell my soul. When your on herion people are like aren't you scared you might die or not wake up and I would think , duh that's the point happy people don't do herion and people who do have a death wish and for me I would rather die then go through 30 days of not sleeping and feeling everything and I mean everything. Water would hurt you when your sick. I was dope sick one day and just sick in general of getting kick out of my house taking showers in diner bathrooms and shooting up in some grimy places that I said to myself if there is a god that is the only thing that is gonna keep me clean I'm obviously not dieing. I would try to overdose on purpose and I always woke up or I would make the decision when I knew I had enough dope to kill me I would end up getting crappie dope. So I knew something was looking after me. Finally   after so much going to hell Aka Paterson and back I got an opportunity to go out to La to a free program called the Dream Center. It was a Christian year long program but I didn't care I knew I needed at least a year after all the damage I did to myself. It was a tough program but that was what I needed and it was an answered prayer cause I once said to my ex bf that I wish there was a place that I could get off drugs learn about the Bible and get a relationship with God and that program was exactly that in a nut shell. I ended up staying for 2 and a half years and became the women's House Supervisor.  I loved it I was able to help girls who came in the program who had the same problems I did and I was able to share my experiences of fear and insecurity with them and share that I came in the program kicking herion not knowing God and having no hope what so ever. I needed to help others in order to stay clean. I came home in 2012 and fell back a little and blamed it on N.J. and Paterson but what I needed to learn that it was neither it was me. It wasn't easy and it still can be a struggle if I make it but it can also be a blessing cause I get to help others and there are a lot of others who are addicted to herion. Back when I was 17 the word herion was foreign but now saying it is like nothing cause you hear about it all the time now in the news papers and out of people's mouths about themselves or there loved ones. IV been clean for sometime now. I made it about mind over matter sone people need programs and meetings I just need loving people in my life and the thought of how much I wanted to die on it and it helps. I'm pregnant now and have a new reason to live and going to have a baby in my life that will love me for me matter what I look like. God works in mysterious ways and I believed I lived through all that cause I was meant to be a mother.

Rochelle,22,Female,Salem,Salem,"As a young couple with not much money, my boyfriend and I moved to Salem from Pennsville.  A year went by with doing well, living a normal life until I noticed a big difference in our relationship. I would work late nights as a server and come home to a man passed out, figuring he was just sleeping every night. One night on my way home from work I called him a thousand of times and got no answer, so naturally I rushed home! When I got home I yelled his name...received no answer. I ran into my bedroom to find him with a sandwich half eaten hanging out of his mouth. Something told me to pull his sleeves up because he was wearing a sweatshirt, and of course I found track marks. I couldn't wake him at first until I slapped him in the face, which then woke him. The next day his family and I pushed for him to go to a rehab, which happened...but only for a couple of days. And this led to two more rehabs after that as well, that only lasted no more than a week. Finally, his family and I called the police after finding him almost gone again and they admitted him to the Salem Memorial Hospital. Salem then admitted him to a facility that he could not sign himself out of without going to jail. Unfortunately, they didn't keep him long and when he got him he didn't stay clean for long. This was leading me to depression and loss of hope! My money was going missing and my family was falling apart, so I decided to pick up and move. The move was great the first two weeks, which we moved to PA. However, two weeks in...he relapsed! This time dangering my children.  Now he's looking to face 3 years in prison and losing his family for good. I never imagined ever having to go though this or having to pray for somebody's life everyday of my own. I hate addiction and what it's done to my love and family. Hopefully one day he won't have to deal with this demon, but for now it's an everyday struggle.  I understand partially but never will I understand how somebody could sell this drug knowing what it does to people.  ",box,,Significant other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,

Melissa,55,Female,Cresskill,Bergen,"Our 23YO daughter is a heroin (snorts) addict (now 4 months clean!) and she has been through hell and back. Eight rehabs, four stints in hospital psych wards from suicide attempts (in addition to others). Picked at her feet so bad they were so severely infected she couldn't walk.
She's stolen money and pills from nearly all her relatives and god knows who else. Broke into her aunt's and grandmother's houses.
She's probably cost more than $250,000 in medical bills last year alone. 
There have been countless nights when she'd disappeareither staying out on her own or thrown out because she was usingand we'd have no idea where she was going (she had no car, no friends and no money. Turns out she would just walk all night since she had no place to stay and didn't want to be picked up by the police).  One winter night at 3am she called me on my cellphone to come to the backdoorshe was literally covered in snow and afraid her father wouldn't let her in after she had been thrown out for stealing from him.
She suffers from severe depression and she was selfmedicating with opiates. Now that she is (legally) medicated, clean, employed and has a car, the depression has lessened and today she announced that she's the ""happiest she's ever been.""  Sounds so easy, right? But she had to be ready and had to want to do the work herself. She still struggles.
We do live one day at a time and know these good days can change at any time (as can bad days) but I am enjoying it while I can (and who knows, it could last a lifetime!).

Dana,38,Female,Woodbridge,Middlesex,"My sister Lisa Flowers died 15 years ago from heroin (indirectly).  If you recall, The Star Ledger did a front page story about my sister and the doctor (Lance Gooberman) responsible for her death in October of 1999.  Lisa underwent UROD (ultra rapid opiate detox) and died within 18hrs after the procedure.  She died 5 days after her 20th birthday.  You see, heroin has plagued my family.  I am one of 18 grandchildren and out of my 18 cousins, 5 have died from opiates (plus my sister makes 6).  I battle with knowing whether the drugs are the issue or its a curse in my family, but I know that I will do everything in my power to make sure my children are not affected by this horrible epidemic. I have since moved out of NJ (6yrs ago) to NH.  I know from my time living in NJ, that the heroin problem is one of the worst I have ever seen  I know that something needs to be done, but Im not sure what it is and Im not sure why the epidemic is so rampant in NJ.  Heroin has taken my sister Lisa from me far too early, as well as my cousins (of which several were brothers/sisters, leaving some of my uncles childless).  A few of my cousins have been in and out of jail many times because of heroin, but every time they came out, they were right back on it because there wasnt any type of rehabilitation.  I think that perhaps instead of jailing drug users (which becomes useless in the long run) rehabilitating them would be smarter.  But also getting to the root as to why heroin is so heavily used.

Debbie,50,Female,Pennsville,Salem,"My daughter fell victim to opiate use when she suffered an injury to her knee. She was prescribed percocet for pain for an extended period of time. When her injury healed and the medecation was stopped she suffered terrible withdrawal. She started getting the pills from family friends that had old or unused pills, when that was no longer available, she turned to purchasing them from the streets. Her tolerance had become so great that she had to take more pills or higher doses just to keep from getting sick and be able to function daily.  When you are addicted to opiates, your body starts to crave them and it's their sole focus. She never told her family or doctor she was suffering because she was a nurse and was embarrassed and a shame, Soon, she was taking 20 pills a day just to not be sick and the cost per pills on the street were 10 dollars a pill. She couldn't afford the pills so she started using heroin which was easy to get and a lot cheaper. When I found out about my daughters addiction she was admitted for treatment she spent less than 1 month at the treatment facility.  She was released and she started seeing an addiction specialist. The doctor prescribed her a drug called suboxone. This drug is supposed to help carve the craving for opiates.  She took this drug for many years and in my opinion although legal, it is just as addicting and you suffer the same or worse withdraws when you want to get off of it. The drug is not covered or wasn't when she was on it by a lot of insurance companies and is very expensive.  While she was taking it, she was not herself and basically was not capable of feeling compassion etc. the drug effects your moods and although it seems to fill the need to use opiates, the three years she took the drug before being free of it were lost years. 

My daughter comes from a supportive family, but what I found out is most people friends/extended family members etc do not have the patience or understanding of drug addiction.  People believe as I did, that people make a choice to take drugs and that they can just stop taking them.  In reality, this is not the case they can't just stop and a lot of people do not have solid support they desperately need to be able to fight the addiction and remain drug free. As in my daughters case, the addict ends up buying or stealing to feed the addiction and eventually finds themselves with criminal charges. Her life was forever altered, now a convicted felon ex drug addict makes finding a new career path very difficult.  My daughter was fortunate in some ways I guess because she was able to get off the drugs and she is rebuilding her life and trying to put it behind her. She still suffers from feeling a shamed and feels that she will always be labeled and will never be able to truly put the nightmare behind her.  She lives with the guilt of what she put her family through and feelings of disappointment.  

My daughter has been drug free for 8 years now and I am so proud of her and grateful she is starting to have self worth and respect for herself again.  ",box,,Parent,Parent,parent1.svg,,

What hurt me the most was my 22 year old brother telling me, as he drove to the hospital not knowing if his dad was even alive, ""ive prepared myself for this the past 18 years. I know im going to identify my fathers dead body"". Because of his fathers addiction my brother had to play caretaker and man of the house. He was in a sense robbed of his youth because he had to grow up so quickly. He doesnt sympathize with his father anymore. Hes angry. I think the anger comes from disappointment. And I think now, for his own emotional wellbeing, he chose to walk away all together. he sees his father as weak and selfish, maybe not fully understanding the nature of addiction. If there is any positive that comes from this is that my brother knows exactly what he ""doesnt want to be"". He will never touch a drug, and excels at his academics, always pushing himself. He will be graduating college with honors this December. The second person was my boyfriend. We dated on and off for 5yrs. I did not know the nature of his addiction until we were living together. I later learned this had been an ongoing problem since he was merely a teenager. It takes its toll on you emotionally. Someone i loved stole from me for money for drugs. We had our water turned off, cars repossessed, all because the money went to drugs. And yes all that was stressful but the money or material things did not matter. Watching someone i love on the break of killing themselves is what mattered. I nearly had a nervous breakdown. Sleepless nights, because as he did bag after bag, i kept checking to see if he was breathing cuz i couldnt tell if he was nodding or not breathing. Countless emotional arguements for him to go to rehab or i was leaving. Watching him cry that he didnt wanna be this way. Watching him get dope sick and vomit bile and he couldnt move because his body was in so much pain. I always thought how could he love a drug more than me? He saw how it was tearing us apart and he didnt care. Yes, there was jail, etc. i wanted to leave so many times but i always thought he needed me, i had to be there to make sure he didnt die. He had noone else. It just finally got to a point, for my own sanity, i just had to go. I excepted in my mind that yes, he was going to die from this, but i did all i can do. I still hear from him from time to time. And nothing has changed. My heart always stops when i see the number because i fear its a call that he is gone. When you care about someone, i think you always will. But i couldnt let his distructive behavior be my life anymore. And although i have 2 people who i love hurt me through their addictions. I dont hate them. Im not even angry. I had to let go for my own well being. Yes it was through counseling and alot of reading on the subject. I dont think either one of them chose to hurt me or the ppl that love them. I dont think they chose to be addicts either. And how ppl think heroin addicts are scumbags and lowlifes. They are not. At one point my stepdad was very functioning and supported a family of 8. And at one point my ex was very successful, we lived on the water and had nice cars, etc.i dont think they woke up one day and said hey, let me really mess up my life and lose everything to heroin.  They are human like everyone else. Stuck in a distructive downward spiral, that hopefully doesnt end in death. Heroin/opiates shows no mercy on age, gender, color, or creed. And it not only destroys the addict, but the people that care for them too",quote,I've prepared myself for this the past 18 years.

Denise,47,Female,Somerset,Somerset,"For 2 years I have watched my baby sister succumb to an unknown demon. Our family finally had answers when she was arrested, multiple charges for possession,  with intent to distribute, and in a school zone. The big surprise,  heroin!  She was never someone you would expect to allow something in her life to be so destructive.  She seemed to be so together.  Good job,  the only sibling to graduate college,  husband,  son,  beautiful home,  really nice car and so much more going for her.  I felt so desperate and helpless watching her self destruct. Desperate to get our mom on board to convince her to get help.  Now her life is on tatters.  Marriage destroyed,  son left without his mom,  husband left in financial ruin... I want my sister back and I want her healthy!  She was forced to detox in jail and now she waits for a chance at rehab,  name on lists,  waiting for a bed to open. Terrified that she will succumb once again,  terified that she will OD, terified that I will lose another sibling,  that I will be the only remaining sibling (lost a brother to a car accident in 1988 and my oldest brother this past fall to cancer).  Last summer I thought there was enough to convince all to get her into rehab ASAP.  efforts failed and then my brother began to lose his fight with cancer.  Our mom has been through too much. She can't lose another child! She called last week to share bad news of my uncle passing,  her baby brother,  heart attack in his sleep.  She called me,  started the conversation with ""I have bad news"". I sincerely expected she would tell me my sister is dead. I don't know how much more our family can take.

Keith,43,Male,Newark,Essex,"After getting my girlfriend pregnant at a young age and my daughter being put up for addoption, I turned to drugs to escape the pain and hurt. Every time I sobered up I found the pain was still there, the hurt was still there, so I picked up and used again. This turned into a 17 year addiction to heroin. I did get married and had 2 beautiful children during this time, but cheated on my wife daily with heroin. In 2006 I had lost everything including the desire to live. I therefore took 90 ... 2mg klonapin, but instead of successfully killing myself I blacked out and robbed the Burger King and Exxon in Phillipsburg, NJ. After doing 5 years in a New Jersey state prison for this crime, I entered a program called New Jersey Adult and Teen Challenge.

Caila,19,Female,Brick,Ocean,"I've always been extreme with everything I do. People always said I took things too far. Back then I never wanted to listen to what everyone was telling me, but looking back now its my biggest regret not listening. I've spent the last 4 years addicted to injecting heroin. I gave away my entire life for the devil, and in return I got nothing. Before heroin, I spent years searching for whatever was ""missing"", and at 15 years old I tried heroin for the first time and my life has never been the same since. My addiction progressed quickly. I was smack dab in the middle of the rise of a heroin epidemic. Heroin became my answer for everything. It changed my demeanor in every way possible. The way I acted, the things I spoke, the process of my thoughts. After a short time of using, things started to change. My friends starting dying, going to jail, going to rehab, getting clean. I sat around and wondered where was my rock bottom? I almost felt as though I didn't have one. I've been beaten up, robbed, had my life threatened, abused, kicked out of high school, lost every job I ever had, lost my friends, my family disowned me, I've been arrested, been to jail, rehab after rehab, program after program, overdose after overdose, slept on beaches and in cars, completely homeless. Staying in random places all throughout NJ...bergen county, atlantic county, cape may county, Camden county, Monmouth county, middlesex county, mercer county, but always running back to Ocean county which I find to believe is the worst. Finally, after 4 years of slavery, torture, and pure hell... I moved to Florida. I have been participating in NA meetings, working the 12 step program with a sponsor, and most importantly staying clean...one day at a time. In active addiction, I cried wishing I could go back and do everything differently. Take certain things back, do certain things better... but I've come to accept that this is my life. That I cant take anything back, I can only  change what I do with today. But maybe, If I had read something like this... if someone could've really reached down inside my pain and told me that things would get better if I simply asked for help or listened when people offered to help me... maybe I wouldn't be where I am today. Everything I have been through has made me a stronger, wiser, and more mature woman. I have learned to challenge my weaknesses, so I can be a better person today than I was yesterday. A better person tomorrow than I was today. But I would never wish upon even a worst enemy, to go through what I did. I pray everyday for every hopeless addict in NJ. I truly believe if you just give yourself a chance you might just realize your life could be worth so much more than what you've let it become. Heroin fucking sucks. It wants nothing more than to watch its victims suffer. FIGHT BACK  ",quote,"I've come to accept that this is my life.

Jen,22,Female,New Milford ,Bergen,"I am a close friend of 4 people who have passed away from their heroin and opiate addiction and a best friend to someone who struggles with it everyday. This has affected me everyday in minor ways that turned major. When the third one of my friends Overdosed back in October is when things started going downhill. I was a college student residing out of state home for a visit when I got a call that changed everything. She died. From that moment on sadness and fear sank in and became a part of my everyday life and thoughts. Sadness because I missed my friend who was young beautiful and had so much and head of her. Fear because my best friend who is more like a sister to me was spiraling into a terrible addiction herself and I was terrified that I would lose her next. Having to mourn the loss of 4 friends all within less then 9 months from each other and fear that my best friend wouldn't get the help she needed I turned to alcohol to help ease the pain and worry. This is what caused me to fail out of school my senior year. The only thing I am thankful for is that my best friend is now clean for nearly 100 days even through the struggle it took to get fhe help she needed and shes still having thoughts that cause her to struggle with   staying clean everyday and I'm am on track to getting re accepted to finish my degree, the downside no more financial aid. My degree will be in psychology and I want to get a license in social work after. Dealing with the pain after nd worry of having this terrible addiction take the lives of my young friends is pushing me in the direction of working with people suffering from addiction as long as I can afford to make this possible. Every time I hear someone new started using or someone recently overdosed it makes me sick to my stomach. I hope soon this problem can come to an end and people can get the help they need.

Stacy,34,Female,Pennsville ,Salem,"Opiates are the devil I face everyday.  Though it's been about 5 years now it is still a struggle everyday.  Most people when they think of an addict they invision an uneducated, unemployed, low life from a broken family that has some kind of horror story to tell.  Well I can attest that is not always the case.  I am an education, employed (six figure a year salary), my parents are still married  (35 years), and I have no horror story to tell.   Like many others my addiction started from a back injury.  One month on pain medications sent me into a two year addiction.  I did things I never dreamed in a million years I would do just to get my fix.  I mean I stole money from my parents. That's the one that haunts me the most.  It was two years after it first started in December when I finally took a look at myself.  I will remind you that I make six figures and I was broke,  my savings was gone,  my bank account was negative 800 dollars, I was stealing money, and my thoughts had turned to heroin  because it's cheaper.  Thankful I had some type of morals left.  I called my father right then and there and told him I needed help and he came right over.  I went into rehab and stayed with it for a year.

One day he was happy, had a wonderful career, nice home, car, traveling all over the world, long term girlfriend....next day I get a call, ""Your son has been busted with heroin""
In that one very second, life changed, the world is different, all you feel is pain, fear, guilt, you think about it every day all day.  It affects every thing and everyone in your world....it's like a death, you wake up with this horrible gut wrenching feeling every morning, and usually 4 or 5 times during the night.  
After 3 or 4 rehabs and 6 or 7 hospitalizations he is clean, now it's time to clean up your mess....fines, medical bills, no insurance, no job, no license.  After you beat the devil, and you realize the pain you've cost your loved ones, and the overwhelming debt inquired, with no job and license, I have to pray and beg God to PLEASE PLEASE give him the strength to crawl out of bed to look for a job to dig himself out of the mess he has made.  So quick...it all happened so quickly, they say I'm lucky, his addiction was only about 2 years, but it will take him many many years to be clear.  He knows he caused this mess and he realizes he has to fix it....but he doesn't see the light, he keeps looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.

Kristine ,33,Female,Gloucester City,Camden,"Noone will ever fully understand addiction until you have been an addict or loved an addict. Addiction not only effects the addict but eventually consumes the soul of the people that love you most, with that said my father was an opiate user for years which eventually destroyed his liver and at 46 years of age was unable to receive treatment for lung cancer which killed him at 46 years of age my father died a slow tormenting death in three months 9 days before my birthday.  My experience with my father was very brief life had a more harsh experience waiting for me in 2010.

   My current spouse began using percocets in 2010, hiding his pill addiction from me on a daily basis for about a year until the pills became to expensive and he was going through withdraw and did not have the money for a pill. A friend offered him a bag of heroine to sniff, the heroine was cheaper only costing 5 dollars and lasting longer, snorting heroine for almost year was a daily habit for him to the point his addiction was costing a 100$ a day and lies and manipulation became so severe heroine was his life. He worked for his habit,lied for his habit and manipulated for his habit. This was just the beginning! 

  In 2012 he became an active intravenous user at this point his addiction flew out of control. He began crashing vehicles after he shot up driving taking three trips a day to camden to feed that monster , bills began to fall behind and money was a constant fight. Two christmas in a row i had to borrow money for our children just to have one as he would spend every dime. The emotional and mental deterioration i was going through was enough to send most into the hospital. Rehabs were impossible to come by and noone takes medicaid most are in North Jersey not South except Merryville which is a thirty day program is just not enough for a heroin addict. 

2013 and 14 were by far the worst years of my life, my spouse had OD about ten times literally dropping dead in the streets of camden to me finding him blue in our shed at eight months pregnant and performing cpr until paramedics came.  He became addicted to the streets and i kicked him out plenty ""tough love"". He became one of camdens blended in homeless walking the streets and it being ok with him. My kids watched me feed him out our window, my daughter has witnessed him od in our bathroom on my birthday as well as i have knocked down doirs and found him in his own throw up. I stuck by this man for so long rehab after rehab and detox after detox.  Ive watched a respected man turn into a junky who doesnt mind living in a shack off of morgan st where all the addicts go to get high or stay while camden metro are fully aware of this shack they allow it to remain. Ive lost so much cars,tvs,respect, and have nothing because i loved an addict.  Addiction is serious and heroin is the devil, its not just the physical withdraw an addict is scared of but its the mental months long. It was never the physical aspect that he was afraid of he felt un normal not himself not high, being hifh made him enjoy life or so he thought , he was happy he felt good and no matter the times he flat lined he kept going back the drug calls them it haunts them even when doing so good the addict in them calls them. America wasnt ready for the heroin epidemic they didnt prepare themselves for it now we watch as our loved ones kill themselves slowly i should not have had to bury my 26 yr old cousin last year due to heroin overdose nor do i want to bury my childrens father one day.  Heroin alters a persons mind its a dangerous drug. The emotional and mental trauma my children and i have suffered from this disease is immeasurable or any one suffering. This drug destroys your soul and your life. The drug dealers sell death on the corners lacing it with deadly ingredients killing people dailythey should be held accountable for every bag they sell that kills someone. 

Camden is a hop away from me and i despise driving there being white and driving through there is horrible, every corner someone is yelling works at you which is needles or the addicts high sitting on the streets. I never understood why you cannot be drunk in public but you can be high, nodding,falling over etc. The prostitution on every corner down broadway simy to feed the addiction. If your white your presumed a drug addict. It is really sad that it is the way of life out there. Ive traveled there many times looking for my spouse just to make sure he is ok, stopping other addicts or woman on the corner,  addiction has ruined and destroyed my life in more ways than one and i hope one day the state takes this disease serious and starts implementing more rehabs in south jersey or facilities and programs that will help south jersey residents.",quote,"My kids watched me feed him out our window, my daughter has witnessed him od in our bathroom on my birthday..",Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,

Heroin takes over lives and in this case, It took over mine. I was just an innocent, 15 year old girl living in an all white neighborhood with big houses and nice cars. One day I was a freshman in high school who rowed crew, got straight A's and had a lot of friends.I was introduced to heroin and over night my life was flipped upside down. I became a slave to this drug. I started using heroin every day and every night of my young life and I thought was I was doing was ""normal.""  Whatever normal even is these days. I stopped getting good grades, quit crew, and got new ""friends"" who accepted what I was doing. This drug has brought me places I never would have thought, mentally and physically. I couldn't get out of bed without it, I couldn't have a conversation without it. I was married to this drug; in an abusive relationship with no way out. That innocent, 15 year old girl quickly turned into a not so innocent 16, 17, 18, 19 year old girl in and out of rehab more times than i could count, prostituting, lying, cheating, stealing just to get one more. I took all the mirrors down in my house so I didn't have to look at myself anymore. I couldn't bare to see who I have become. I really didn't know who i was anymore. I lost those teenage years to heroin. He won the war but I won the battle. I am now 20 years old, living on my own, paying all my bills, I am now a manager at a car dealership and have responsibilities. I take care of myself today and I don't have to wake up and the first thought is how am I going to get one more today? What do I have to do to not be sick? Instead, I can get right out of bed, make myself a cup of coffee and be at work on time and be a productive member of society. If I could reach out to just one teenager out there and let them know its not worth it then I would spend my whole life preaching this. I could talk all day on some dark, evil places my drug use has taken me. I've seen more things in those years that no one should have to endure in a lifetime. Truth is, sometimes, I still think about that little 15 year old girl. Where would I be if I didn't spend years dedicating my life to heroin?

Brandy,28,Female,Union Beach,Monmouth,"I always thought of myself as a hard worker, loyal friend, responsible, and trustworthy person. That was until I dated a heroin addict. 
My first experience with heroin was dating my girlfriend at the time. I didn't understand it, I didn't get it, never understood how serious it really was. I was so wrapped up in trying to help her get clean, I completely lost myself in her struggle. I put every bit of energy I had into fighting her addiction for her. Nothing that mattered before had the same importance to me, my family, my job, my money, or my safety. I lived this crazy life, far from what I ever imagined for myself for another year until I finally got the strength to end it. 
The next relationship I was in, only a few months later, was where was I was all over again. Right back at it, feeding another girlfriends addiction. I again gave everything I emotionally and financially had. I couldn't even sleep a full night through without waking to check that she was still breathing. I became so scared of everyone, kept my distance from all my friends and family. I didn't want them to know the truth. I wanted to ""protect"" her image so I spoke nothing of how things really were. 
I was so alone. I had no one. I didn't even have my girlfriend because she was so lost in the drugs she was just an empty shell of a person. I didn't even know her anymore, but yet I couldn't leave her. I was scared of her. I didn't know what she was capable of. It was terrifying. 
I don't know who I was fooling everyone saw what was happening. It's hard to come up with excuses why a grown woman can't keep her eyes open or her head up straight, why she can't even carry a conversation, or make sense when she talks, or why her arms and hands are so swollen and covered in red marks and scabs, or the extreme weight loss or soul less, empty looking eyes. To think back and really believe I had people fooled really makes me see how sick I was too. I didn't even know who I became. 
When the money ran out things only got worse. I  couldn't keep up with supporting myself plus her, and her extreme drug habit on top of it all. Things started going missing. I had to hide my things in my own home. Nothing was safe though, there is no safe place living with a heroin addict. When I was out of things to steal and sell, I thought things had to get better. I was wrong, my families things started going missing. Everyone knew! I felt like I was a disappointment to them, how could I let someone so destructive into their homes. How could I put them at risk? I felt so much shame and embarrassment. 
It was a sad, low point in my life, but when I was finally confronted and forced to face the truth things only got better. I realized I wasn't alone. I had people that loved me. I got myself out of that toxic relationship and really dealt with the damage that was done. 
Dating an addict is hard. You can't help who you fall in love with. Deep down, I know she was a great person but she lost her way. She became someone she wasn't. I wish she never took that first pill that led her to what she became, but she did, and I can't change that. Change is possible, but only they can do it. It's a life long journey, that only an addict in recovery can take. 
I feel for anyone that loves an addict. It's not easy loving someone so much, but never feels that love in return. It seems nothing matters to them but the drugs. 
What I learned from my experiences of loving a heroin user was to never forget about the love for yourself. Heroin is so strong that it doesn't only effect the person using it, its damage extends way further past the physically and mental for the abuser, it emotionally takes a toll on anyone that loves and cares for that addict. 
Always remember your value. ",quote,I completely lost myself in her struggle.,Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,
Edward,22,Male,East Brunswick,Middlesex,"The stigma of addiction is killing more youth than any of you can imagine. Heroin addicts are shamed and fearful of seeking help especially in suburban America. I was addicted to Oxycontin and other prescription painkillers when i was 19 years old and went to treatment when I was 20. I started using again shortly after and went on to heroin because it is much cheaper and easier to find then pills. I was hopelessly addicted to heroin for a few months before I finally had enough and had hit bottom. Today I am 22 years old and have over 15 months clean from all drugs and alcohol. I am entering my senior year at a state university and hopes to graduate with a Business Administration degree. I am almost done with my summer internship and have two other jobs. I have my family back in my life and the best friends in the world. I see addiction first hand every day by attending mutual support groups. It's only getting worse out there. Heroin has a new face in the state of New Jersey and it's white middle/upper class. I do advocacy work with Young People in Recovery to raise addiction awareness and to educate the youth as well as collaborate with like minded organizations and lawmakers to help stop the stigma of addiction and make it easier for people to seek help. There are 23 million people in long term recovery from addiction/alcoholism in America and most of us are hidden behind the blanket of ""Anonymous"". Heroin is an epidemic and it's nice to see NJ.com start writing about it more openly. New Jersey is ground zero. With cities like Newark, Paterson, Camden and New Brunswick making drugs readily available and never a far drive from any suburb in New Jersey. I've lost three friends to heroin overdoses since I've gotten clean and seen countless others pass from the neighboring suburbs.  Recovery from heroin addiction is very possible if you want it. I am living proof.",quote,Recovery from heroin addiction is very possible if you want it. I am living proof.,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Brian,23,Male,Brick,Ocean,I am a former addict but I must never forget I will always be one. Ive been through it all from being homeless and dead a couple times waking up with police in my face and being inside a hospital. Herion took everything away from me. My family my friends my car my home I was a athlete growing up I was anti drugs till I picked up my first one and one thing led to another but it was my choice to do herion and when I did we fell in love for a couple years.

Tiffany,26,Female,Pine Hill,Camden,"My little sister just turned 24 and let me say that this is really hard to write without my eyes filling up with tears. I only have one sister, one builtin friendforlife and I don't have her. Heroin does. Around six years ago now, drugs started to take hold of her life. She started with moderate ones that people say ""everybody's tried"" and eventually came to heroin. Her behavior started to get fuzzy. She would scream at people and fly off the handle for no reason. She beat me into a bloody swollen pulp when I was 21. 

Several months later, she tried rehab for the first time. My nowhusband and I tried to be as supportive as possible. The rehab employees said that cigarettes were an acceptable and even helpful vice when you're in rehab so we drove over an hour just to bring her some packs. Unfortunately, it didn't take. She went right back to her old lifestyle and the friends who were in the same rut she was.

She ended up moving in with a man with a violent criminal record who dealt drugs and all day, they just sat in this dark basement getting high and going to Camden any time they needed to get more drugs. She became more and more distant, shutting herself off from distant family members entirely and calling us, her immediately family, very rarely in brief moments of sobriety. My young children, her nieces and nephew, have seen her only a handful of times but they always ask for their aunt. 

Sometimes when she would speak with my mom, my mom would be so full of hope. She would call me and talk about how convinced she was that my sister would finally be coming back to us. Then she would see nothing change and her hopes would be dashed and heart broken as she cried to me about how guilty she feels, how she can't sleep at night because she's afraid of what's going to happen.

I tried to keep some semblance of normalcy and gather together sometimes, as a family should, but it always ended in disaster. She would fall asleep at gettogethers and despite trying to rouse her, she wouldn't wake until the festivities were over. Finally, we mandated that she be sober for any gatherings or she would be turned away. Sobriety always meant she would be mean, vicious, and scary. 

For her birthday this year a few months ago, she showed up at my mom's sober and she started screaming at her before she got in the door. Due to many hospitalizations because of her arms becoming infected, her arms were three times the size of normal and covered in scars from having to have infections cut open. Her face was grey and dull, her teeth were worn and brown. You have to understand, my sister used to be stunning. She was a relatively tall, beautiful girl with perfectly symmetrical features. She was a cheerleader and she could have been a model. Her arms are permanently scarred now. If she ever wants a normal smile again, she will need dentures. Hopefully time will heal the sunken appearance her face has taken on but it is no doubt that heroin has caused irreparable damage to my little sister and to our family.

The man she lives with now believes that he is helping her by buying her drugs so that she no longer has to sell herself to get them. He says that now she gets out of bed only to eat, use bathroom, or get high. Either we will bury her too soon from an overdose like so many before her or she will spend the rest of her life in a bed, wasting her years on a feeling that isn't worth losing everything that ever meant anything to her. There is another possibility, the outcome we're hoping for, that she will come to her senses and seek rehabilitation for the final time and she will change her life for the better. This outcome, though, will be the hardest journey of it all and I'm not sure she can even see clearly enough anymore to know that there are still people who love her and are willing to support her through that journey. All I know is that I would give anything to have my sister back, the one I grew up with, the one I argued with all my life but hoped to become a best friend to when we were grown and living out our lives. I would never take that sisterhood for granted again.",box,,Sibling,Family,family.svg,,
Sara,31,Female,Edsion,Middlesex,My Boyfriend is/was a user it started with pills and escalated he started sniffing and that escalated to shooting it.  It got to the point where I realized stuff was missing he was taking peoples money when they weren't looking anything to afford a fix he collapsed several veins in his arms he looked like a human pin cushion.  He ended up getting a severe infection in his hand from missing so many times. You would think that would have been a wake up call but nope he used the spot they put the iv in his arm to shoot up I can't tell you how many times I have flush full bags empty bags tossed his needles.  It was an endless fight hopefully one day I hope he realizes I was trying to save his life. It scares me to death to think I might loose him like all the stories I hear we are in our 30's even I had my fun when I was in my early 20's but there's a time you need to grow up and realize drugs aren't the answer.  I myself am allergic to any kind of opiates so I don't see the point of doing something that makes you sleepy and then if you don't have it makes you sick.  He is in jail at the moment and he is clean I think the violation of probation he had saved his life I really do.  ,box,,Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,
Lindsay,31,Female,Hazlet,Monmouth,"Heroin and opiate addiction have affected me in a few different ways. Not only am I a family member of person with an addiction to pain killers, I have lost my 20 year old cousin to a heroin od in 2013. I also am a Licensed Clinical Alcohol and Drug Counselor and Licensed Clinical Social Work and I work with people who are addicted to drugs on a regular basis. 
I have witnessed first had the trauma this addiction causes everyone involved. I have seen the heartache it has caused so many people. I have watched my cousin go from the top to the  bottom at record speed. I watched her try to better herself and kick the addiction, but the addiction was too strong. She should have just graduated with a degree in social work, but, instead she has been dead for a year. 
I now get to see her mother struggling with pain killer addiction and refuse to get help and doesn't care about who she hurts while doing it. I also get to see my grandmother distraught on a daily basis because of my aunt and cousin. It is extremely hard to be in my position, because I'm the LCADC LCSW and I should know how to fix my aunt  (atleast that is what people think) I know I can't fix it but it is very hard to see my family so upset over my aunt.  It has now come to the point with my aunt that for my own mental health have to cut ties with her until she decides she wants help. This is one of the hardest things I have had to do, but enabling her isn't making it any better.

Kelly,29,Female,Hamilton,Mercer,"I got addicted to opiates while recovering from a complicated csection and drs who were all to eager to keep prescribing. I've spent the entirety of my 5 1/2 yr old sons life as an addict. When pills became to expensive I was reluctantly introduced to heroin. I didn't want to do it but the withdrawl pains were too much for me. I ended up with a needle in my arm within one week of trying heroin. The hold it has on people is indescribable unless you've experienced it. I am happy to say I've recently detoxed, and am actively working a program to ensure that I remain sober. I am a mother of three boys who deserve so much better than to have their mother taking from them to support her habit. I'm a sister, daughter, mother, cousin, friend, wife ....

Ashley,30,Female,Woodbridge,Middlesex,"Both my younger sisters have been addicted to opiates and herion. Their addictions started in the upper township/ocean city, nj area. My youngest sister started opiates in high school and still has addiction problems to this day, even though she has been through a rigorous nj state aided program called sunrise house in northern nj. She is now 24 yrs old with 1 child and another on the way. Her first child was born addicted to opiates and was in NICU for the first month of her life and kept on phenobarbital for 6 months. Even still after being opiate free for over a year a doctor prescribes her a medication which acts as an opiate substitute and allows her to take while she is pregnant. 

My other sister is a heroin addict. It is unclear when she started using heroin as it started with recreational drugs in high school and later turned to opiates then heroin. She has been in and out of several nj state funded program and has never completed a single program. She has over dosed and died on more than 3 occasions and come back. To this day she still struggles with her addiction is cons everyone around her into getting what she wants. The drug has even landed her unknowing landed her in Vegas as a prostitute. She was high in Atlantic city and a girl she met asked her to come to Vegas with her. Before she knew it she was on a plane all expenses paid and there was a pimp there to pick them up at the airport. She had no idea what she had gotten into until the high wore off and she was in an apartment with 10 other girls being groomed for the streets. It is fortunate for us she found her way home after 2 months.  She is now 27 yrs old, had never had a job longer than 2 weeks and lives at home with our mother.

Sally,62,Female,Vernon,Sussex,"I am a parent of 2 sons that were heroin addicts.  It has been hell for my entire family for the past 10+ years and I still struggle with the trust and the worry every single day.  I believe they are both clean now and they did it on their own, one had to because he was in jail and the other one had no insurance and we had tried getting him help by calling all kind of places asking for help but were turned away.  He was told once that he would get county help but after 5 days of detox they kick him out to say they had no beds for him to get any additional help.  He is the one who really needs it still the most now, I see him struggling the most each day, I believe he has mental issues as well, like depression.  I really think what got them clean is the love of family and the fact that we would not give up on them got them through it. It is very hard for them to get jobs since no one wants to hire them with a record. I think the laws are going to have to change on that as well since there are so many more being arrested each day for drugs.
As I have stated I am 62 years old and the money that we had used to try and get them help is horrible, I don't think I will ever see retirement. The one was in rehab 3 times so you can imagine how much that cost us. Besides the fact that people who have no one who is involved with any kind of addiction don't understand what you are going through, they are usually the first who will judge you or make negative comments about you and your family.  I have lost so called friends over this and I know my boys have been judge by people who don't even know them.  They were good kids their whole life they were the kind of kids who were never in trouble in school who got alone with others and I am sure there are so many others out there who are the same as my kids.  It is so sad that we are losing these kids to something so horrible and no body knows what to do.   I don't think putting these kids in jail is the answer, at least for my son he got no help being in there.  No education, no counseling, no rehab at all. We really need education on how bad these drugs are and we need to tell them early in our schools and in our communities.  I think we need to try and get some of our kids who were able to get clean back into the schools and let them talk to our kids and tell them how bad it is for them and how easy it is to get hooked on this horrible drug.

I got clean because I was spiritually and physically exhausted. My spirit had been shattered, and everything I had known since I was a young child was gone. I had given it away. In my last days using, I was running around Atlantic City with a guy I had met in my previous rehab, doing anything I had to do to get one more taste of that horrifying high.

I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t see what was coming. I could have easily said I had a problem in my early 20��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s, but I was the only one who didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t believe it. I was in and out of unhealthy relationships that were based around mind and mood altering substances of some sort, and I was convinced that it was okay. It was okay because this is what people my age did. Just because I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t go to college back then didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t mean I couldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t party like a college student. Just because I had responsibilities like family and work didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t mean that I couldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t uphold them just because I was hung over or jonesing for one more. 
I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t start out addicted to opiates. In fact, as deadly as that family of drugs may be, it was really just my last resort. I was a vodka and beer kind of gal for the majority of my using, and eventually that led to the doctor shopping for Xanax. If there was weed around I would smoke it, but I chased the drugs that lowered my inhibitions and seemingly made me feel more confident. But then I found heroin. I found it and I loved it. That young man that I met in my first inpatient treatment center was helping me find pawn shops, selling the beloved rings off of my fingers, which were the last things I had left that were gifted to me from both my mother and my father before my father passed away. We sold a brand new laptop for a mere $80, and he got mad at me one night when I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t accept a proposition from a 50something year old man to go back to his room for a few $50 chips from the Tropicana. But, I was hooked. I was hooked on the feeling the drugs (including the combination, all of my drugs in my system at once) gave me, and I was hooked on the feeling of having someone to share my hell with, even if he added to my misery. See, he was street smart. I was na��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____ve and easily intimidated. I supplied the goods to get the money, and he supplied the courage to walk up to a stranger and ask where the good dope was.

In late February of 2011, I found myself in a hospital. I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t know where my car was. I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t know where my clothes were. I had two phones, and I didn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t know where those had gone, either. I told the hospital I wanted to kill myself ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____ not because I really did, but I knew that those were the magic words I needed to say in order to get a warm blanket and a piece of bologna between two pieces of defrosted white bread. I left that hospital and went home to my mother, who was already packing my bags for me and barely had a word to say to me. The last phone call she got from me, all she could hear were the noises of cars passing and honking along a highway ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____ there was no voice on the other end, and her imagination assured her that her worst fear had come true. She had believed with every piece of her that I was dead. She had the Atlantic City police looking for me, and I don��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t know who the detective was that was helping her find me, but she speaks of him often and frequently says how she would love to thank him for his efforts and kindness during those terrifying few days.

I finally checked into a wonderful detox center, not because I wanted to, but because I finally understood that it was either continue running on the streets of Atlantic City, die, or stop fighting what was good for me. I decided that maybe detox would be a good temporary fix. Warm meals, cozy beds and protection from the brutal February weather. I told my counselor there that I wanted to go somewhere that was spiritually based. He quickly made a phone call to a treatment center in Florida, and within a day I was on a plane. I figured, if anything, it would be a nice vacation. 

As time went on in that treatment center, I was forced to face the consequences of the decisions that my disease had led me to. I had hurt my mother, and my two older siblings. I��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___m sure when my father was alive it pained him to see me the way that I was, and I��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___m more sure that it pained him to see what I was putting my mother through. When I went to Florida, she had recently been told that her breast cancer was in remission. When my mind cleared, I realized that while she was going through not only chemotherapy and radiation, but the aftermath of the devastation of losing her husband of 32 years, I was putting her through more hell than any of those things combined. All this woman wanted was a break, and she sure as hell deserved one. Me going away was not only the best thing for me, but the best thing for her.

I stayed in Florida for a little under 9 months. I went to a place called Transformations Treatment center, then I went to a halfway house combined with a wonderful outpatient called the Recovery Associates of the Palm Beaches. This treatment plan for me was intense, but it opened my eyes to how amazing life could be. I was having fun, making friends and enjoying my newfound freedom.

It��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s about realizing that addiction in and of itself is a prison. It��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s torture. It��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s a disease that I wouldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t wish upon my worst enemy.

Flash forward to over 3 years later. I have stayed clean through working the program of a fellowship of my choice, which is available to any and every addict. I now dedicate my time to doing things to pay it forward and help other people. Also, that girl that thought she was entitled to live like a college kid who wasn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t going to college is now in school, maintaining A��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s and B��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s. I have a plan for my life today, rather than a plan for the day to get over the hangover and search for some type of drug to get me out of myself. I have a wonderful relationship with my mother, brother and sister. I share a roof with my mother today, but we also share stories, laughter, favorite TV shows. We share a bond that people might have after averting a disaster with one another; which is, in essence, what we did. I have hope for my future today, and I maintain hope for others, as well. Don��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t get me wrong ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____ I would not be here today had their not been consequences for my actions.

I wouldn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t be here if I had been handed the key to lifelong recovery. Recovery takes work, patience, pain, tears and time. Recovery is a process, but I need to approach it as a daily task rather than a lifelong one. It is such a wonderful feeling to wake up in the morning with a clear mind, able to move my body without the pain of withdrawals, and know that I have a choice today. The disease of addiction no longer confines me to a personal hell. Recovery from the disease of addiction has been affording me the opportunities to do things like drive across the country with friends, choose a major for college, and treasure the people in my life that love me despite my past. Recovering addicts have lived two lives, and are by far the most amazing, inspiring and honest people I have ever known (besides my mother, of course). 

I urge anyone who is quick to pass judgment on drug addicts and their families to educate themselves. This isn��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___t just an epidemic, it��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s also personal devastation. We can look at the newspapers and obituaries all we want, but until ignorance regarding this disease is confronted and corrected, not much is going to change. A few months back, I saw Governor Christie on the news with Jon Bon Jovi at a treatment center that I know of in the North Jersey Area. That was the only time I ever saw our governor publicly address the issue of addiction. Our jails are overcrowded, waiting lists for beds in treatment centers are sometimes stretched out to month or two wait times, and the drugs out there are getting scarier. I grew up in middle class suburbia, as did many of the friends I have who are also in recovery. This is not just an urban problem. The disease of addiction does not, and will never, choose it��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___s victims based on their upbringing or environment. It takes who it wants, when it wants, how it wants. No one needs to die from this disease, and I am living proof that recovery is possible. Although I cannot put my entire story on to paper, I can say that I have hope for others because I, myself, am a miracle. The issue is not who is doing the drugs, the issue is that the resources for help offered to those who need it from professionals are not available enough. We are throwing the addicted into prison for a temporary fix, just to get them off the streets for a little while. They are stuck in there with the same feelings they had when they were using, and are released no better than when they went in. New Jersey needs more beds, less hurdles for those who need help, and more involvement and acceptance from the general population. 

There is no shame in being an addict ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____ we did NOT choose this disease. But, we can choose to do something about it. I am blessed beyond words to be an Addict in Recovery, but I am one out of millions of recovering addicts. What a shame, though, that recovery is not a word that we are able to use freely without stigma. Those who seek solutions to their problems deserve to hear from people unafraid to speak about their process with recovery. We can be proactive as a community, and we can hold the families up who are watching their children, husbands, wives and siblings slip away from us due to this treacherous disease. I urge those who are too afraid to say that they are in recovery to use their voices to help others. I urge you to break your silence, show the world that you are miraculous, and push forward despite the lack of education among those who are inexperienced and uneducated regarding this disease. We are living, walking proof that there is hope. Recovery is a lifelong process, and perfection is never attained, but we can change lives with our voices. Hopefully, someday, society will follow with their own form of acceptance, and lives can be saved. 

One of my many wishes for this world is for the ignorance surrounding addiction, which is held mostly by those unaffected by it personally, to disappear. For life to be celebrated rather than condemned due to the word ��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____addict��_��__��_��___��_��__��_��____��_��__��_��___. We are not bad people. We are getting better, a day at a time, with the help of other people who are just like us. 

So, society, step up and stop judging.

Carolyn,26,Female,Hamilton,Mercer,"Both of my parents were heroin addicts. They were never fit to take care of me. My mother was negligent and lost custody of me because of her drug and alcohol use. My father told me lies, stole from me and my family, he cared about no one but himself when he was using. His use of heroin and pills destroyed our relationship and eventually lead to his death. He had contracted Hepatitis C from sharing dirty needles. His liver was greatly affected. He was eligible for a transplant, but because he didn't listen to his doctors and kept using pills, he was dropped. Eventually, his liver failed, he was put on comfort care and passed away. They both had been through several rehabilitation programs and jailed several times. My mother had been trying to get better, but due to other circumstances and long time suffering and abuse to her body, passed away due to internal hemorrhaging and sepsis. Addiction is an illness and should be treated as such. These people need help and without realizing it, or caring, because this drug takes ahold of them, they hurt everyone around them.

Anonymous,Anonymous,Female,Oak Ridge,Passaic,"I have watched numerous people kill themselves with heroin.  One of them, being a very close friend/younger brother to me who was like a brother to my brother also.  I have two siblings who have both been heroin users and opitate users.  My brother overdosed, was rescusitated twice and in a coma for an entire month and then had to go through months of rehabilitation.  His battle with opiates seemed neverending and what we witnessed following his overdose I wouldn't wish for anyone.  I can still remember every minute of his coma from standing by his bed everyday in the hospital doing anything and everything to try to wake him up.  I can remember my mother at the hospital from 6 a.m. in the morning until they would actually ask her to go home and get some rest at night.  I can remember every minute of the night they told us he wasn't going to make it and how all his organs were shutting down and do we know how long he was without oxygen.  I can remember them asking us what he was on and we couldn't even pinpoint because what type of opiate wasn't he on.  I can remember seeing him in the emergency room when they allowed us in, they worked on him and at one moment he opened his eyes and looked at me and then the monitors went off and they threw us out.  Late that night they told us he was in a coma.  They told my mother he would never wake up, but we prayed everyday.  I knew he was still there.  When he woke up it wasn't like the movies or t.v. shows.  It was real.  He didn't speak, instead he squeezed my mother and my hand so tight and manage to squeel f*&* in the strangest manner ever.  He wasn't fully there.  He couldn't walk, he couldn't talk, he couldn't wipe his ass, he couldn't wash, he couldn't even feed himself, he couldn't do anything!  It was a long recovery period that affected us in ways we don't even speak about too often today.  I despise opiates/heroin more than my worst enemy.  I now have a sister who struggles with the same addiction even after everything we have been through.  She had been to countless rehabs only to end up in the same place.  She is selfish and unbearable because that is what heroin and opiates turn her into.  She is killing my mother.  When I say it again I mean it more than anything I DESPISE opiates and heroin!!!  Everytime there is another big drug bust that happens I gleam with happiness.  I can only hope they keep cleaning up and get rid of all the heroin and opiates that circulate our towns and are killing our loved ones.  They need to take more control of doctors and such since a lot of the opiate addiction has begun with that.  There has to be further research to find new pain medications that are nonaddictive and put into use more often.  It makes me sad for everyone and anyone who is affected by what is going on in our communities these days.      ",box,,Sibling,Family,family.svg,,
Patti,47,Female,Haskell,Passaic,My brother used heroin in the 80s shot himself in 1982.

Michelle,25,Female,Roselle Park,Union,"My fiance is a heroin addict. He finally admitted it to me a few months ago after months of suspicion he was taking something. Personally I have never come close to even smoking a cigarette and when he admitted to me his problem I was taken back by what he was actually doing it made me scared and nervous. We have a 16 month old daughter and my fear is that this continues. Thankfully, at this moment, he has found it in him to stay away from the drug after kicking him out of the house and 3 types of treatments (2 failed). Heroin makes a loving and calm person into a monster. The amount of fights, yelling, and tears that have come about due to the use of this drug is not a life I thought I would live with the person I love. The itch and cravings he gets from this drug causes him to leave the house to get more and more. A couple of weeks ago was his last relapse where I caught him actually dozing off in the car in a parking lot near our house while mixing the drug with water to inject it. It's heart wrenching to see the person I love self destruct and as I've said to him before if he doesn't get fixed I will be forced to part ways because I refuse to raise my daughter in this environment. No matter the love that I have for him there comes a point where I will have to make a choice between my daughter and me or him if he does not find a way to get better. I have stood by his side through all of this and I think he has finally found a method of treatment that personally helps him. Everyone is different and may not take well to a certain treatment, therefore, I recommend that if someone truly wants to get better that they don't give up and look for a treatment that will benefit them.",box,,Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,

Susan,58,Female,Hamilton,Mercer,"My youngest son died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 28. He was a sweet, kind soul who's life was taken away by addiction, denying him the many opportunities life could have offered him. His passing has left me and his family with such a deep, painful loss that nothing can repair. the stages of grief change often or felt at the same time: denial  this isn't real, he'll be coming back through the door, he didn't die from an overdose: anger  that his life was taken in such a way, so soon, and at whoever provided him with the heroin; bargaining  if I had only helped him to get clean (of course I had no control over his using), if I had only found him sooner to save his life; depression  this is constant and hardest to fight every minute of every day, my heart aches with the loss...; and acceptance  unfortunately, I haven't gone through that phase yet, it's even hard to say the words ""he is gone."" My only salvation is in helping others: going to Naranon meetings  talking with and helping other families who have an addict in their lives; attending G.R.A.S.P. meetings  for those who have lost a loved one to addiction; and by helping raise funds for City of Angels NJ, an organization that provides support to addicts by helping them find places for recovery and even helps pay for it if they can't. I pray for other parents and families who are suffering as I do; I pray for the addicts to want to recover that they find the help they need.

Brooke,24,Female,Mantua,Gloucester,"     My name is Brooke Donegan.  I am a twenty four year old college student, waitress, daughter, big sister, girlfriend and friend.  I have been battling heroin addiction since I sniffed my first bag when I was seventeen years old.  I remember that day like it was yesterday.  My friend and I were driving home from Camden, I put the dollar bill in the wax paper bag and inhaled through my nose.  It was a disgusting smell and an even more awful taste, but my body instantly started tingling everywhere.  It was a warm, comforting sensation all throughout my being.  I knew I had found the answer.  I knew I had found the secret glue that I had been missing my whole life.  I immediately fell completely in love.
     I threw up profusely the rest of that hot, summer day.  I was sweating and I was so itchy.  It did not matter, nothing mattered anymore because I felt invincible.  I felt at peace for the first time in my whole life.
     I went to my first rehab when I was eighteen years old because I had experienced my first overdose on July 31, 2008.  I was told that a UPS guy found me on the side of the road, barely dressed and gave me CPR which saved my life according to the doctors.  I went away because that was the first time I felt like I might not be invincible.  I was scared to die.
     I stayed clean in Narcotics Anonymous for a little bit over a year.  I felt accomplished and wanted to be a normal college kid.  I started drinking again in October 2009.  I was successful until June when I accidentally got pregnant on birth control.  In July, I had an abortion against my better judgement and picked up heroin again shortly afterwards.
     I stayed high for three years after that.  Seven totaled cars, six documented overdoses, rehabs, halfway houses, geographical changes and nothing made any bit of a difference.  My mom could cry all day long and it did not matter.  It did not matter how many times guys took advantage of me or what happened when I walked around Camden alone at all times of the day and the night.  I still loved heroin more.
     I have always been a decent writer.  I've kept diaries most of my life and I am currently going to school at RutgersCamden (ironically enough) majoring in English, minoring in Psychology.  When I was high, I started writing in a blog because I felt so hopeless.  I was convinced that I was going to die and that blog would be the only thing I would leave behind.  I was shocked when people started reaching out to me saying that they had read my blog and that they did not get high that day because of what I wrote.  That was not my intention at all.  I have not written in it in awhile, but it is something that I refuse to give up on because it definitely has a special place in my heart. www.inlovewithheroin.blogspot.com
     On October 6, 2012 I gave up the fight.  I surrendered because I was 22 and my life was pathetic.  I was completely disgusted with myself and refused to look in the mirror.  I was so tired of behaving like a scumbag.  I am not naturally a scumbag.  I felt hope for the first time in years.  I got clean that time through AA.  It worked for about seven months.
     I stopped trying to stay clean and started living life.  I got caught up in work and I picked up a margarita one night while I was on vacation.  A week later I was back in Camden shooting heroin again.  I stayed high in Camden for three weeks again and decided to change.  It was the first time that I got high and I wasn't satisfied anymore.  I was alone and I knew that if I kept doing it, I would end up back in all of those dark places all over again.  Just for today, I am not willing to go back to those awful places.
     I have been clean since May 22, 2013.  It is the most time I have ever had.  I go to school in the same neighborhoods that I got high in.  I write for the school newspaper and volunteer at the soup kitchens in Camden to try to make a difference in the same city that almost killed me.  I am currently going through Hep C treatment, I contracted it from using dirty needles.  I will be on the medicine for six months.  I am saving for my own apartment and plan to move out in a few months.  I got my license back.  I've kept a job.  I bought my own truck.  I have my first boyfriend who has yet to stick needles in my arm and who opens car doors for me.  I have real friends.  I rely on Narcotics Anonymous to show me how to live without drugs.
     My addiction affected everyone around me and my addiction made me exactly who I am today.  I am a beautiful young woman.  I am a type of woman that I used to admire and think that could never be.  I am grateful for my addiction because I am so much wiser and so much more humble because of it.

Araya,57,Female,Plainfield,Union,"At present I have 18 years clean from alcohol and street drugs, i.e. crack cocaine, heroin, powder cocaine. However, in 2006 I relapse using prescription drugs. The prescribed drugs I used were any pain killers mainly Percocet. It ruined my life. I almost lost my marriage, I did lose my job because of it. I decided to seek treatment. It was only by the Grace of God my husband had insurance. I had started taking Suboxen but when I went for treatment, they took me off it all at once. It was a horrendous withdrawal. The insurance only paid for 15 days which wasn't enough. I ended up going back on Suboxen and I can't seem to get off this drug but it is also helping me live my life. Unfortunately my husband was diagnosed with Lung Cancer and passed away in March of 2011. Now, trying to get back on my feet I'm working on my Masters degree in Addiction counseling. My five year plan is to open a house for women. I see the issues of older women like myself still in the street with no place to go and no way to get clean. It's an awful situation.

He found the love of his life and married her. Shortly after I confronted him about him not coming around and being different. He was not the kid I knew and I felt something was wrong. He was crying for help inside and admitted his addiction. I offered to pay for him to go to Florida to a rehab in Jan when he received more time off at work.

It wasn't until I finally violated probabtion, got arrested and had found out in prison that I wAs pregnant that I finaly got the help I needed. I'm clean As of today, thank god! But it's not easy.

Lynn,29,Female,Ridgewood,Bergen,"Where to begin? Well i hardly fit the stereotypical heroin junkie. But i assure u looks can be deceiving. For the last 2 and a half years iv been living a double life. Nurse/wife/daughter/sister/friend... A cheating/lying/stealing heroin head. Its exhausting. A little history about me. I grew up in ridgewood. Had the all american childhood. My parents gave me everything and more! They are still happily married. I was raised with good morals, church every sunday ect.. I played sports,made varsity as a freshman, did every after school activity imaginable. After high school i went to college and got my RN nursing degree. I was in a sorority had lots of friends. I met my now husband in college, we got married a few years after college. I started working as a nurse right out of school. We live in an extremely nice appartment we both drive high end cars, i literally had everything iv ever wanted at that point in my life. That was 2 and a half years ago. 
      Starting in high school i had experimented with drugs. Smoked weed a handful of times, i hated it. In college i had moved up to some harder drugs like cocaine and mushrooms... This was an occasional weekend thing. Percocets were around and i loved those but again, weekend type of thing.  It wasnt until i was 26 a coworker of mine mentioned she had her hands on a bunch of roxicets which are known on  the street as ""blues"".  It perked my interest so i grabbed a couple. At first it was still a ""weekend"" thing but  it quickly spiraled into every other day to every day. Before u knew it my tolerance was from a quarter of a pill at a time to 3 or 4 pills being snorted at a time. When i wouldnt take them id be ""dopesick"" and i knew i was in trouble but i wasnt stopping it just fueled the  need for more drugs.  When my supply for blues went dry i would hurt. Id be sick irritable id call out of work in search of more pills.  One desperate day someone offered  me heroin. ""No way""!!! I thought.. Then my shivering sweating nauseous aching body didnt care, it will make me feel better? Ok ill try... This was the begging of the end.  Once i started doing heroin that was it, i was in love. My savings went, i maxed out credit cards on cash advances, i stole from everyone around me.  One thing iv learned about addicts is despite our bad choices we are incredibly smart, im a master manipulator, and best damn liar out there. Great qualities to have right?? My first attempt at getting clean i had confessed i had a problem to my family and they secretly helped me do a cold turkey detox at home, it was 2 weeks of pure hell. I was clean for a few months then quickly spiraled again. I went away to detox a few months later. Well, i went in snorting heroin and came out shooting up the next day. Stints in detoxes and therapy has been my life this last year.  At first i was good at living this double life, i think i just got too tired and the need for heroin trumped everything i had in my life. I lost my nursing job. My husband left me, he cant deal with the lying and stealing or not knowing if he will find me dead. Noone trusts me. I have not a dollar to my name. Heroin has literally taken the life out of me.  I couldnt make plans to do anything i once loved because finding the time to drive down to paterson trying to cop drugs was my second job.  This drug is no joke. My life is completely broken.  Im trying to rebuild the pieces but  its a slow process, and one thing about being an addict is i thrive on instant gratification.  This is a battle i face every day. Will i beat it or let it beat me? Who knows... ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Preston,55,Male,Berlin,Camden,"January 11, 2010.  I can not think of a sadder day in our families' history.  My stepdaughter, Alyson Amour, under the influence of heroin was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident in Camden County which resulted in the death of a NJDOT worker.  The sage advice ""you have to wait until they hit rock bottom"" was a reality for my wife and our family.  The heroin addiction had presented to us in 2004, and the system failed my stepdaughter.  Despite top notch medical insurance and a loving mother...a mother that never gave up despite numerous challenges, the system, as a whole, failed my daughter.  We encountered ""rehabilitation"" facilities that seemed more interested in insurance company revenue than actual patient rehabilitation.  Our family physician at the time actually stated ""I don't have any patients with drug problems"".  The criminal justice system is filled with incompetence, and we are now experts in dealing with people who actually don't care about inmates.  There is no real rehabilitation programs at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, in fact, with the exception of Camden County Drug Court, the entire system seems flawed and filled with incompetence.  The happy story is Alyson's status today.  From my observation, the sobering fact that she killed a person whom she had never met was the catalyst in her recovery.  She has had to deal with a criminal justice system which does not care about drug userswith very little programming.  The facilities are worse than public housing.  The food/medical care is terrible.  However, she has quit smoking.  She is drug free.  She is maintaining an ""A"" average in college courses offered by Drew University and local community colleges.  She is an active participant in a ""working dog"" program and now has a skill set training dogs.  The most impressive thing she has done is participate in Project PRIDE, which marries at risk high school students with inmates willing to speak about their addiction challenges.  She is really good at delivering her total message, and is trying hard to make a difference.  To say that we are proud of her goes beyond words.

We are facing a similar challenge now with her brother, although the problem is prescription medications.  The challenges are noteworthy.  There are problems with the ""rehab"" center mentality.  Our willingness to be dominated by the pharmaceutical companies.  The relative ease in which we can obtain heroin/opiates on the street.  The criminal justice system.  The stigma that may follow her as a convicted felon.  The lack of opportunity that is associated with this illness.  Social discrimination as very few people understand the power of addiction, and the problem.  ",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,

Stephanie,32,Female,Cherry Hill,Camden,"My name is Stephanie and I fell into addiction of heroin at the age of 21 I was born and raised in cherry hill, my family sent me away to college, which I graduated from Stockton college in 2004 with a bachelors degree in criminal justice.  I was a normal run of the mill kid, I drank in my teenage years but heavy drugs I never experienced or was exposed to until my early twenties.  My using began when I got into a relationship with someone who had battled addiction to heroin since he was 13.  Though he was clean when I met him, a few months into our relationship, he relapsed, and introduced me to the drug.  I didn't know that heroin was going to alter my life in ways that would take me beyond my worst dreams of what hell could be like, and make them an everyday reality. I started our sniffing a line or two here and there to using 24 bags a day thru a needle.  Everything I had imagined I would never do in my life, became regular day occurances.  A woman who was learning criminal justice in college soon would learn more hands on by being on the streets of Camden and in the system of almost every correctional system from here to Gloucester to Burlington counties for all different felony charges and misdemeanors.  The child my parents tried to raise to the best of their ability they watched turn into a skeleton and demon of their once sweet child.  I robbed from my family friends, and even strangers, stole everything I could until even they would no longer enable my behavior and sent me out in the world to fend for myself and my drug use.  my parents changed the locks on the door in the dead of winter hoping it would be enough to get me to want to be sober, only to realize days had turned into months as I made a new home running the streets of Camden, and living in hotels from night to night with money I made from shoplifting and selling it to different places for money.  My parents had spent many restless nights waiting for the call that their daughters body had been found in a ditch somewhere, and I was too selfish to even check in with them to let them know I was alive.  Heroin and cocaine were my only fuel and drive, I lost a job as a manager at a huge swimming pool corporation I worked at, and  I was no longer able to hold down a job for more then a month or two, either from no call no shows, or stealing from the registers and anything else I could get my hands on. I managed to try a few short term programs to get clean along the way, methadone detox which i realized mixing heroin with it, only made it more potent.  After 30 days of the program i had a bigger habit then when i started detox.  I tried take home buprenorphine shots, they would work for 2 weeks tops and again i was back in Camden.  What i came to realize is i wasn't just addicted to the drug, it was the high, it was the life, it was the ritual of using every single day.  My using consumed my life and was a full time job, i would get up at 10am and run around making money and buying and using drugs until 11pm at night only to wake up and do it all over again.  Going weeks without a shower, wearing dirty clothes, unable to rememeber the last time you saved a dollar for a burger off the dollar menu and having people staring at you in disgust.  The worse part is when you are using, you cannot see the collateral damage you have caused to your body, track marks on you hands and arms so bad you have to wear long sleeves.  Or black eyes because you almost got robbed in a dark ally at 1am in north Camden, by someone pretending to sell drugs, or getting a gun pushed to the back of your head because someone tried to car jack you in east Camden.  This all becomes the calamity of your life when you are using, and everyday is really a miracle to make it to see another day.  In a matter of three years I found myself on probation after catching 13 felony charges for credit card theft and fraud, a stolen car charge, and over 20 municipal charges.  Probation sentenced me to two years on their program, and still I continued to use and give dirty urines, I was continuing to shoplift, and it became so bad that I was literally spending more time in jail then I did outside of jail. After 22 dirty urines and 16 new charges, probation didn't recommend me to a program, they didn't recommend me to a rehab, they told me they were violating my probation in two months and a judge would decide if I could be reinstated or if I was going to do an alternate sentence.  I showed back up at my parents house trying to get clean for even a day because I couldn't imagine going back behind bars after doing 180 days only one month prior.  I begged my parents to send me to rehab, but here is the problem, i had no insurance, and i had burned bridges with my parents and stole so much money no one was willing to put faith i would stay anywhere they would put me for treatment.  the cheapest rehab cost 35k with half of the money needed up front, and no one had that kind of money.  I managed to convince my parents my using was cheaper then rehab, and it was no longer to get high, it was simply so i wasn't sick.  I was a half functioning skeleton just trying to get thru one day at a time by not wanting to kill myself from the withdrawal again begging my parents for just one more day under their roof and ten more dollars to go get better. i was arrested again and my violation of probation ensued, they offered me prison, and they offered me drug court because of how many charges i had caught in such a short period of time.  I took the drug court, and they released me back on the streets, i deceived the system again, squeezing in one last hoorah of binge using until finally i was arrested again, this time drug court was sending me away to rehab, since i was never officially given the tools to get clean and sober, nor gave my body the chance to clean up on its own away from the environment i was doing my using in.  i was locked up in jail 4 months before a bed was available at an inpatient rehab, i spent 3 months in inpatient, went to a halfway house for 4 months after that and learned how to live life all over again in a healthy and therapeutic way, learning why a child raised in the suburbs with a silver spoon in her mouth  ended up a full fledged junkie on the streets of Camden.  Drug court saved my life, the officers always believed in me they pushed me when i was ready to give up and go back to a life of a using, and i completed a 5 year program in only a year and a half.  I graduated in 2008 and just celebrated 6 yrs clean in june. im pregnant with my first child and i have a management position at a thriving business, although i wish my life would have went differently, i learned getting sober what it is like to exist in life, and i also have been given the gift to LIVE in this life, and i will not go back to that life at any cost.  I have seen more people in my life in the 6 yrs i have been sober fall into the addiction of opiate pills and heroin.  People like me that never used before, i have lost a lot of people along the way from using and overdosing.  Programs are lacking in NJ at a reasonable cost  heroin and pills have trickled out of the city into the suburbs and affect people from the ages of 12 all the way into adults in their 80's.  People are dying everyday and it has become an epidemic.  ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Pavel,28,Male,New Brunswick,Middlesex,"I began using heroin at age 19 while a college student at TCNJ. My addiction became worse over the next few years but I somehow managed to get good grades and was even accepted to medical school when I was 21. Before I started medical school I was arrested twice for drug possession and that dream ended. For the next two years I was severely addicted to heroin, working odd jobs and committing crimes to obtain more drugs. I was arrested numerous times. At age 23, I decided to get clean and entered treatment. Six months later, while still in treatment, I was arrested for a crime I committed 9 months earlier, and spent the next 2 1/2 years in prison. I'm grateful to say that I stayed sober through the whole thing and I now have over 5 years. Clearly I can't be a doctor, but I will completing my masters degree in social work this spring and working in the field of addiction. Things didn't turn out the way I expected and I went through a lot, but things are great and I truly believe things happen for a reason. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Nicole,41,Female,Jersey City,Hudson,"On October 13, 2014, it will be 6 years since my brother overdosed on heroin. I will never forget that morning when my brothers girlfriend called me. I had talked to him the night before and they were supposed to come over and sleep over. That was a Sunday. I worked about 10 hours that day and to be honest, I really didn't want company. I talked to him about 5 times that day and the last time I did talked to him he told me that he was just going to stay home and watch movies with his girlfriend. I went home and make kielbasa and sauerkraut, watched tv and went to bed. I heard my phone ring about 1am and didn't answer it, it was my brother. I then heard my phone ring about 9:30 Monday morning with weird numbers I didn't know, so I didn't answer. About 9:45am I see my brothers girlfriend calling. I answered it and she was crying. I said ""Laurie, what's wrong"" She said ""It's Johnny"" I stopped in absolute fear and asked ""Is he OK?"" and she said no. I said"" I don't know what's your saying, OMG is he OK"" and again she said no. I said I don't believe this, even though I knew what happened without her even telling me outright. I then hung up with her and called my boyfriend and told him about the phone call. He said he would call her and he then called me back 5 minutes later and told me. I screamed, I banged my head against the wall, I punched the wall and broke down and felt this sense of loss that I never felt in my life. I cried, threw up, pooped (sorry), threw up, cried, stared into stared into space. I really don't remember how long I sat on the floor after that. Then I couldn't stand still, I was in a dream and I kept banging every part of my body on the wall to wake myself up. This couldn't be happening. It couldn't be happening. I just spoke to him last night, we had plans on moving down the shore, we had plans, WE HAD PLANS. In my heart I knew why this happened. I then took the Xanax and Vicodin I had for myself and flushed them down the toilet, but not before taking 3 Xanax to calm myself down. I never been through this before but I knew the next thing I had to do was make the phone calls. I called my parents, who knew already because the sheriff was already there. Then I had to call friends. But before I did that I had to go to the liquor store and prepare myself. I called everyone who was on my contact list. It was so surreal that I was living in a fog through all the conversations I had. I threw up again and again and again. I remember I kept punching that wall screaming no. NO! THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING!!!!!!! I couldn't breathe, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I couldn't think. I never felt anything like this in my life and I didn;t know what to do. I drank and drank and drank and yet, I couldn't get drunk. I lined up the beer bottles against my wall to remind myself how much I actually drank. I was dead sober. The loss I felt was unimaginable, intolerable, numbing, surreal, unstable, it emotionally took my life over. I would just walk and stare into space wondering if he had come over, would he still be here? But then I thought, if he did come over and it happened in my house, I would of seen him dead. They would have had to lock me away because I would of went insane. For the next 2 weeks they did an investigation because at first they thought he was murdered. His girlfriend is/was married at the time and is ""connected' He knew of my brother and our family thought that she or he had something to do with it. I demanded an autopsy but my mother didn't. So with this fight going on it took longer then usual for him to be laid out because of the conflict our family having over this. She finally agreed and it was done. Again, in our hearts we know why this happened. Now let's turn back time a little. Me and brother started drinking and using drugs at a young age, It was mostly pot as the drugs of choice and never really tried anything hard, at least that's what I thought anyway. He had lived with me so I seen what he was doing first hand. I didn't know that his addiction was that bad until he started stealing from me and my mother. I still let him live with me because he was my brother and I loved him. I didn't have a choice. He started doing heroin about 2 years before he passed and overdosed 3 times and one time on cocaine. I found him once laying on the couch and I woke him up and screamed at him that I wasn't going to his funeral if he died. He did wake up and composed himself. That's when I knew there was a problem and that's when i started getting scared. There were times when I walked in and the house smelled like vomit. I didn't understand about the vomiting until I started using Oxycontin. He stole the rent, my pay, DVD player and thousands and thousands of dollars from me. The only time my head and mind were at ease is when he went to rehab. he went about 6 times and obviously each time was futile. I knew in my soul that this was the way he would pass away, I knew it. There was nothing I can do. I couldn't help myself, how could I help him? About 7 years ago I started taking pills. It was mostly Xanax, Vicodin, and Percocet. It wasn't until about 3 years ago I started using Oxycotin and Oxycodone. I didn't feel ashamed about it because I didn't think it was the same as doing actual heroin. In actuality, it was. I was doing the ""poor mans heroin"" as people say. My friends and family all knew I was doing it and everyone came down hard on me. I couldn't stop because it was a feeling that I didn't want to end. i stopped paying bills and even stole from my friend a few times to get pills. Was I going to end up like my brother I always thought. But I knew my limit and those couple of times I didn't know, I finally realized why my house smelled like puke when my brother was using. For anyone has done pills or heroin, you know what I am talking about. The withdrawals were absolute murder and even when I didn't want to use, I had to because I needed that feeling to end. it was torturous. I swore that I would never make that phone call and get pills again. I lied to myself because I always did. The last time I took Oxy was about 2 months ago. The only reason why I haven't is because I cannot find them, not because I wanted to stop. I don't want to stop. I do get Percocets and Vicodin once and awhile but it's not the same. Even though I don't do them as much as I used to, I know I'm an addict.His birthday just passed on July 17th, he would of been 40. I knew I had to get something to get past that day.  took about 3 percs and about 5 Xanax, and drank. I was so messed up that I feel asleep while getting a tattoo. Who does that when you are going through all of that pain? For the next couple of days I was on the same path until I couldn't get the pills anymore.  I lost my brother over drugs. I knew it in my heart even before his body was cold. But yet, I continued and continue to use pills. We are addicts, but he lost the fight that I continue to battle.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Christopher,26,Male,Port Monmouth,Monmouth,"Opiates took my father away about a decade ago. While working he injured himself a few times over the course a few years. Each time he was prescribed pain killers.  When he passed I wasn't fully aware of the reason as the toxicology report wasn't immediately available. I also didn't fully understand the dynamics. In short, the overprescription of painkillers in the late 90s/early 2000s are the reason my father is not here right now. He fell asleep one night and never woke up.

Rachel,23,Female,Middletown,Monmouth,"I was 16, at a house party. Everyone else was doing it. My boyfriend at the time handed me a tiny blue pill, and with out a second thought I swallowed it. Before that I had smoked weed, drank even did some coke, but I had no idea what I was in store for. The next few days I ate more of those little tiny blue pills and before I knew it I was 19 years old with a needle in my arm. It went so fast from that teenage kid at a house party to a dirty junkie. My family was scared of me, I had no friends, my only love was heroine. I robbed cheated and stole for my next fix and when options ran out I used my body to get the next one. I was miserable inside and out. I was okay with that fact that my once pretty face was covered in scabs and scratches and that I would die this way. April 20 2011 that all changed. I was living on my aunts couch and she had found my ""set"" and any heroine addict knows once your needles are gone it's scary. So needless to say I panicked knowing that my family now had proof of what exactly was going on. My dad showed up, sat me down, and cried. I've never seen that man cry before ... But he sobbed and told me that he refuses to bury his daughter so I'm going to rehab. No choice. I wS scared, angry, and dope sick. The kick was the worst part. Sweats shakes, tears but that's over now. I have not touched herion in 3 1/2 years. I am now a mother and a friend and most of all my family who once stayed up worrying sick over me knows I am healthy and safe. I am forever grateful for that day.

Will,25,Male,Jersey City,Hudson,"Throughout my years growing up in New Jersey, many of my close friends have been sucked into the abyss of opiate addiction. More than one friend has died as a direct result of using, and several others are still in their battle against addiction as we speak. I, too, am suffering from addiction, and am in withdrawal as I type this. 

To an outsider, 90% of the people I know who deal with opiate addiction do not look like one who would typically be associated with drug use. Middle class, mostly white, good grades growing up, nice kids with good families. These are the kind of people who getting hit the hardest now, as heroin is coming out of the cities and into the suburbs. The problem of drugs in the inner cities has long been ignored by the most of the population in New Jersey, thinking of it as a ""hood"" problem, but now as their kids and friend of their kids are becoming victims in their epidemic, there is a lot more attention. There are a lot of good people wasting their lives getting high, living day to day, and they can't get past the trap by themselves. Once you get into an opiate addiction, days and nights blur together and time passes at the drop of a hat. You don't even realize how quickly the days, weeks, and months pass as you go about your day thinking about being high or getting high. Even before the addiction gets to that point, when a person is just using every week, or every other week, they don't realize what they are getting themselves into. After drinking alcohol or smoking weed, opiates just seem like another way to get a buzz, but before you know it, you're wanting that buzz more and more often, and by the time you realize how bad your addiction has gotten, it's too late and it has taken over your life.

I have been using opiates on and off for almost 6 or 7 years by now. Heroin for about 2. In the early years, I wouldn't think anything of doing some oxycodone on a weekend to chill out and get high. Over the years, I'd want to get pills almost every weekend and get that high again and again. I've also gotten myself clean during those times, and it was never that hard. Maybe a day or 2 of withdrawal symptoms, then an easy week or 2 or 3 of being clean before I decided I wanted to get high again. A couple years after that, after being clean for quite some time, I decided to go looking for oxy again with a friend of mine. An old connection for oxy said he only had access to heroin now, and we decided to do it. Cheaper, and just as strong, if not stronger (quality is never reliable, but cheap prices make it worth the gamble) as oxycodone. Since then, I was doing heroin almost every week, two or three times depending on the money I had, and I never really thought I had too bad of a problem, but with my experience now, I definitely did. Over the past 2 years, I've gone from doing heroin nearly every day, with some clean days interspersed, to getting clean for 45 days and getting over withdrawal symptoms before that voice in the back of my head whispers at me to get high again. It is, and probably always will be, an ongoing struggle.

One thing I've learned is that there are no happy endings. You will either die, get arrested, or if you do somehow get yourself clean, you will forever be shadowed by the addiction. Recovering addicts are always going to be recovering, for the rest of their lives, and they will always have the stigma attached to them. You can see it just on this site, how some people looking in from the outside see addicts as ""lowlives"" , ""losers"" , and ""scum bags"". It's not just more help from the government that we need to help recovering addicts, it's a shift in the view the public has on addicts that we also need. I have already written way more than I intended, but I do hope someone actually reads this. Heroin addicts are people, and probably people you know.",box,,User,User,syringe.svg,,
Sarah,28,Female,Leonardo,Monmouth,"I got addicted to opiates on accident back in 2006. Eventually, like most addicts I graduated to heroin within 2 years due to it being cheaper and more easily available. Unfortunately I am not alone in this as both my mother and father are in the same boat. I went to rehab in February 2012 and had nearly 2 years clean before I returned back to NJ for.a visit that would do up being because the Christmas gift of round trip tickets was forfeited to go towards my parents habit. 

I wasn't rich growing up, but after my parents started their own business in early 2000, we were comfortable. Now, my car was sold while I was in Florida for drugs. Their business is obsolete, they've had two cars repo'd in the past year alone, their house is in for closure proceedings and they haven't paid any utility bills in 6 months all because of a stupid wax baggie. Attempting to get treatment has been nearly impossible with my mom being om on a waiting list for several rehabs for over 2 months. I've had my slip ups since being home, but with the constant supply of drugs in the house things could certainly be worse for me. But I've seen irresponsible money hungry doctors blindly prescribe monstrous amounts of potent opiates for ailments that can be cured by Tylenol (if there are any present at all) and then cut people off like it's nothing when either the heat gets to turned up on them or if they feel that their patient is too reliant. I've seen people do horrible things to those that they love just to avoid being sick. Heroin has ruined my family's lives and there's no sign of it getting better anytime soon.

Dawn,40,Female,Bridgewater,Somerset,"At 40 years old , I never thought I would be planning funeral arrangements for my 36 year old nephew. But here I am, he passed away this past Saturday from an accidental overdose. While we are unsure of the final drug use , heroin was his drug of choice. Last October we found him in a hospital in a coma after being missing for 3 days. We traveled everyday for 2 weeks to be at his side all day.  Once he was out of the coma, and into Rehab he was given a choice to leave. Just like many other addicts, he left. My nephew would have given the shirt of his back to someone in need. We were extremely close and in his short life, I watched him become someone I hardly knew.  He would move from NJ to FL back and forth. He always found a source. He struggled with addiction for many many years. You think walking away and not helping them will make them realize... It doesn't. So here I am trying to fundraise for a funeral for someone who should be enjoying life, with a family and a bright future. Thanks to heroin, and various other prescription and non prescription drugs, my children no longer get to see their Cousin, my Sister no longer gets time with her Son, my Mother will never be able to make potato pancakes for her Grandson, and I will forever remember the beautiful blue eyed, blonde haired kid that loved everyone!",box,,Family,Family,family.svg,,

Sam,25,Male,Dover,Morris,"My brother became addicted to heroin while as a young adult and was fortunate to overcome this battle with the help of the Morris County Drug Court program. While being raised by a single mother, his addiction began after dropping out of high school and grew into an epidemic. Violence and stealing ensued, even from his closest family members. It wasn't until he was arrested by law enforcement (turned in by a family member), admitted into a halfway house from the MCDC program and given counseling was he able to turn his life around. The stories and examples that were shared in the house during that valuable time gave my brother a sense of hope, worth and will to overcome his problems. It wasn't easy but after 6 years in the program (included drug tests every week, calls from probation officer, regular court appearances while his license was suspended, etc), he was able to graduate from it. He received his GED, was able to learn a skill, worked his way up into a great job and now has a beautiful family raising two children. The one constant over the years was a very supportive family and friends who cared for his well being. It's all in the past now but we still haven't forgot that terrible time and reminded us that it can happen to anyone regardless of socioeconomic status.

Ameen,24,Male,Parsippany,Morris,"I am a recovering addict, my sobriety date is May 10th of this year. I was a high school and collegiate athlete. Unfortunately my playing days were cut short, as I needed my knee operated on. Sports, specifically soccer was everything to me and as soon as I knew I wasn't going to be able to continue playing I turned to my prescription drugs as a get away. Sports were something that I did for my entire life, since childhood and so it impacted me a great deal. Once I became dependant on the pills, I started making the transition to heroin because for me my addiction was progressing and I couldn't afford the pills so it was cheaper for me to make the switch. But like any other disease, my addiction got the best of me as I nearly got into tons of legal problems and was losing the people who were dearest to me. That's beside the fact that I lost many friends and acquaintances along the way. One thing I must say, is through a strong support system which was my family who never gave up on me and always so the great deal of potential I had ( that throughout my active addiction I no longer saw) they helped get me into a treatment facility overseas. Which the help of the facility and my desire to get my life back on track, today I am blessed to be able to still achieve what ever it is I want to do in life. Today I have the choice to stay drug free, and I am thankful each and every day that I was truly tested, but now I acknowledge that adversity only makes one stronger.

Erika,30,Female,Lambertville,Hunterdon,"I met my best friend in Kindergarten. We have been friends for over 20 years. She got her  nursing degree about 5 years ago. She was doing great, had her own place, full custody of her son, we would see each other almost every weekend, then..... she met him. He seemed like a nice guy, typical hippie type, down to earth, easy to talk to.. He introduced her to opiates. At some point she was going to three different doctors in the area to get percocets to feed her new habit. Then she started stealing percocets from her patients and that's when she lost her nursing license and everything was a spiral from that point. Percocets were to expensive so she started using Heroin. I knew she had a problem but I would NEVER expect Heroin.. Apparently she was using for about a year, our visit were less and less, I would get calls in the middle of the night of her sobbing, we would make plans but there was always an excuse. Her parents found out and she went to Rehab out of state, she came back looking fresh, vibrant, Alive! But unfortunately that didn't last long, I kept telling her that she should go to her Aunts in upstate NY just to be out of the area but she wanted to be close to her son. Today, according to her (users become extremely good liars and I just cant trust her yet), she goes to a methadone clinic everyday which is also very very expensive, and lives in the Poconos area, her son stays with his Dad. We talk once in awhile but its not the same. She is lucky to be alive but lost EVERYTHING she worked SO hard for.

Francis,62,Male,Denville,Morris,"My stepson, now aged 30, had had various dependency issues since high school, starting with pot. While it may or may not be a gateway drug, you cannot convince me that is was not for him.  During his college studies he was hospitalized for a period of time and given Oxycodone/Oxycontin by the bucketful.  when he got out he was hooked and got involved in stealing from anyone and everyone living with an enabler until he returned home.  Shortly thereafter he went into withdrawal and we shipped him to rehab  the first of at least a half dozen attempts.  We found syringes and pills in many locations and lived wit lying and denial for years.  Finally after a longer period of sobriety he was arrested and did time for many other things, got cleaned up again, violated probation and got rearrested.  Last year during the holiday season, right after another rehab stint he relapsed, over dose on heroin and was dead before being resuscitated twice.  this was either one last cry for help or a suicide attempt.  Subsequently incarcerated again for violating probation he is trying once again to get his life in order.

Kristen,27,Female,Howell,Monmouth,"I began taking roxicodone ('blues' as they were known) in my early twenties. It provided an instant high, a means of tranquility, of contentment and ultimately, numbness. It began with small doses, 25 milligrams. But as time wore on, my tolerance increased, and so did the dosage. Within months I progressed from taking 50 to 100 to 200 milligrams a day. 

I was employed full time. My job paid well. But my paycheck that was deposited on Thursday was gone by Friday handed over to a dealer. The availability of the drug skyrocketed. It was everywhere. If one dealer wasn't available, there were three more numbers in my phone book who had what I needed. 

After months and years, taking pills was no longer a means to get high but something i did to avoid the withdrawal systems that plagued my body. Sleepiness, sweating then chills, runny nose, constant sneezing, loss of appetite, dramatic weight loss, and leg cramps that felt like shin splints.  

My depleted saving and weekly income were no longer enough to support my habit. I maxed out my credit cards. 13k in cash advances. I pawned my jewelry at one of those 'cash for gold' places. When that ran out, I swindled jewelry from my mom and sisters. Swiped cash from my parents. Stole my sister's debit card. Irreparably damaged the relationship with my entire family, 

I had become an unrecognizable person. For the moment I woke up until the moment I fell asleep, I thought of nothing but where to get my next fix. To get that one pill and stave off withdrawal. 

I wish I could say there was a moment where the light switched flipped on, but the reality is much more anticlimatic. I was presented with two options: attend an outpatient rehab facility or find a doctor who could help. I chose the latter. He prescribed me the drug 'suboxone.' It's meant to block the receptors in the brain that receive the opiate. 

Years have passed and I now faithfully take the suboxone but that drug has it's own pitfalls. 

It's marketed as a 'solution' to opiate addiction but very few people know about the side effects and it's own array of withdrawal symptoms that accompany it. It's trading one drug for another. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,

The scary thing is doctors wrote prescriptions for a synthetic heroin called hydrocodone, which is 10x more powerful than morphine, these drugs are heroin however the health care professionals do not call them that.  It is a terrible addiction, and I have seen all natural endorphin's made by body to combat pain and pleasure shut down. The body relies on the drug and needs more and more of it to avoid horrible pain and withdrawal. It is a sickness however it corrupts body, mind and soul, leaving the person with no conscience. People without a conscience are a scary breed. After years of living with this disease I left with my teenagers. I lost all material possessions however gained my sanity back. It was well worth it.
    Another scary reality is the social workers Division, and heath care professionals do not recognize this as a problem. They could not spot it and refused to look at it  even while it was staring them in the face. I had evidence of prescription abuse however no one would look or listen. If I could do it over I would have left years earlier with no contact. As I also became ill living a lie and paranoid about the consequences my kids and myself would suffer when the truth was exposed. Gratefully, my teenagers will not drink or do drugs as a result of seeing the effects first hand. We are left to rebuild our lives starting at zero. The one priceless thing we have is a strong support system, our church. So, one day at a time we get by with a little help from God and our friens.",box,,Significant Other,Significant_Other,lover.svg,,
Bernadette,65,Female,Parsippany,Morris,"Heroin has devastated my family!  My eldest daughter died from an overdose 12 years ago.  She was an intelligent, caring and beautiful young woman, a graduate of Villanova University and 29 years old.  My son, who is now 38 years old had struggled in his late teens and attended rehab 5 times and was in 3 halfway houses over a 3 year period.  He went into recovery and was able to graduate college and become a teacher.  He lost all of that about 6 years ago when this disease reared it's ugly head again.  Relapses and rehabs became a large part of his life as well as jail and legal issues. He is in another rehab now.
Both of these young people never caused any problems for me until their drug use started.  Even through all of the worst times, there was never aggression but lots of lying and stealing.
I am one of the lucky ones because I have 2 other adult children who have never had a problem with drugs, and I know some families are not so fortunate,
Drug treatment is merely a band aid on a gaping wound.  I occasionally work in a detox as part of my job as a nurse and the treatment is measured in hours, sometimes with no available rehab.  I have discharged people who weren't fully functioning because their time was up.
I guess I should stop my ranting now, but I could go on and on.  I have seen heroin and drug abuse from both sides of the fence and it truly is  devastating.",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Alex,23,Male,Trenton ,Mercer,"I had a minor surgery in 2011. My primary doctor kept prescribing me pain medications, increasing the doses and eventually giving me stronger medications. I no longer could tell if I was in pain from  the surgeries or if I was in pain from withdrawal. Eventually I started doctor shopping, it's easier to get a script of high dose oxycodone than it is to get a script of suboxone in this state. My work has sufferered, my school has suffered, my relationships with my family is almost non existent. I technically have a chronic pain condition, so I'm still taking the medications. But every day I wake up knowing I'm addicted to these pills and I can't live without them. I also can't live with the pain. I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. ",box,,User,User,syringe.svg,,
Sam,38,Female,Jersey City,Hudson,"        We were together just short of ten years.  We dined out nearly every Saturday evening. We visited Atlantic City every other month or so. We had a partial season ticket package at Yankee Stadium (before it was torn down).  Then, we bought a shore house.  We spent endless days on the beach. Perfect nights at home grilling dinner and watching our Yankees.  It was perfect. I was  loved him unconditionally. 
        Then,  he hurt his back. Then, he was prescribed pain pills. Then, he learned he liked them. Then, he learned he needed them.  Then, he lost his job. Then, we could not renew our Yankee ticket package. Then, we couldn't dine out over the weekend. Then, the unemployment ran out. Then, the prescription ran out. The doctors wouldn't write any more.  Then, I was paying all of the bills alone. Then, I received the foreclosure letter. Then, I borrowed from my pension to keep the house.  Then, my jewelry went missing. Then, cash from my purse, pocket, drawer, hidden under the carpet went missing too. 
        Heroin is cheaper on the street than prescription pills. He stole form me to support the addiction. I confronted him. He lied. I suggested meetings and treatment.    He said didn't need any of  that. I then acceptable the unbearable fact that I was his enabler. Then the only realization worse than that, I accepted that he was never coming back. his entre persona had changed. He was repetitive. He was incoherent. I realized that if we could go to dinner together on a Saturday night, I didn't want to. He was gone.
         It was only then that I knew I had to leave. Without me, he would be without and the monetary needs to support his addiction. But, he would be without food and shelter.  How could I leave him like that? I was guilt ridden, yet he was the addict and the thief, but without my enabling him he may not have reached that point in his life. 
        So, I left after ten years, two years ago. I filed Chapter 7. It is a ten year financial sentence to make retribution for enabling someone I loved to become an addict. Two years later, after losing his home, his relationship, his livelihood,  he has begun a program to treat his addiction. 
         My hope for his success goes beyond my deepest emotions . I want him to be him again. The world lost a wonderful person.

Mike,27,Male,Union County,Union,"I've been addicted to opiates for 5 years now.  It started in college when I would periodically do painkillers recreational.  It was something I rarely did and usually only succumbed when somebody I knew had it.  When I graduated and got a job, I started using more often to balance the boredom of being out of college.  As time went on the addiction got worse; and as my tolerance increased my funds decreased.  I am the opposite of somebody who would use heroin.  I never thought I would touch the stuff.  But because the price is more than half cheaper, I went that route.

Being addicted to opiates has completely ruined every aspect of my life.  Even knowing how damaging it is, I still cannot mentally get away from it.  People don't realize how hard it is to stop, because if I go 23 1/2 hours a day rejecting the urge it only takes that half hour to mess up.  Medication has been helpful, but even that does not fully stop the urge.  

I hope this epidemic goes away soon.  I know for a fact the reason it started was from crooked doctors.  Some of these doctors have shady offices and accept cash to write down a script.  With these pills so available 5 years ago, it led to a bunch of young people with physical pain and no money, turning to heroin as the only 'better' alternative.  Rehab is an option, but it's not desirable due to my full time job.  It's a horrible situation that I would never wish upon anybody",box,,User,User,syringe.svg,,

Sheila,52,Female,Maplewood,Union,"I received a call in June 2010 from my brother in law telling me that my sister was passed out at home with the kids when a neighbor knocked on the door. After she was admitted to the hospital we learned that she had overdosed on heroin. To say we were shocked is an understatement.   Nobody in the family had any idea she was using.  We later found out she was addicted to painkillers  the gateway drug  for years.  She lost her house, her children, her husband and all her friends. Her son who is now 14 is very intelligent but is acting out in school because of his anger with his mother. She lived in a beautiful home, complete with a new pool and lovely furnishings.  She drove a Mercedes, had time shares and wonderful vacations. She never had to work.  It appeared she had it all. Her husband provided everything.  Since then she has been in shelters, jail and is now a thief and a pathological liar.  She steals from family members and strangers.  When she could no longer afford it, she moved on to heroin because it was less expensive and easier to access.  She begs money from people on Facebook making up lies about why she needs it.  She says she has cancer, my Dad has cancer, her dog needs an operation, her daughter needs a communion dress. Whatever will get her money.  She has been in and out of various rehabilitation centers.  Nothing works and we cannot believe a word she says.  My Dad keeps giving her money to pay her rent; however, I do not believe that she is using the money for this purpose.

Since then (2011) she has worked mostly waitressing jobs, getting fired regularly.

J,25,Male,Westfield,Union,"I never thought it would happen to me. I was on the verge of graduating college from a prestigious school when it all began. If I only knew what doing that first painkiller would transform my life into, maybe I wouldn't have done it. I can't say for sure. But things rapidly progressed. Half a pill became one, one became two, and quickly I was doing ten plus per day. I COULD NOT function without them. I was fired from my job within months. School, which I was credits away from being done with, was not even a possibility anymore. I had lost all hope, my spirit destroyed, and dreams crushed. I was a soulless human being, simply a zombie with the sole purpose of getting one more. And when the little money I had ran out, heroin became the only option. Something I said I would never do. Within months I was shooting it, constantly getting arrested all over the state. Running out of gas on the parkway over and over again. Moving to Newark to live near my dealer sounded like a great idea at times. I did everything I said I would never do, and I did things I never even thought were possible. My brain was hijacked by opiates. A small painkiller habit quickly turned into a heroin and crack habit. My only friends were my drug dealer and my running partner. When I lost my running partner, the person that for a long time fueled me to keep going, I finally gave up. We were a team. And once she was gone I knew I had few choices left: continue going on by myself, risking more arrests, being ""sick"" every single day, or going to rehab. Many people in my town leave for rehab. The sad reality is that most don't stay clean. I told my father I needed help and he said he had been waiting for me to say that for years. I was beaten physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I was ready. I went away for 27 days, in NJ I'd like to add. I didn't have to go to Florida. I came home after 27 days, but not alone, with the Vivitrol shot. The shot gave me an opportunity to build a foundation in which I could start attending meetings and put my life back together. I quickly got a job, making half the money I used to make, and slowly I rebuilt my life. I finally graduated college and am now looking for a job in the field in which I graduated.

Percocets, Valium, xanax, and roxy's (blues).  It didn't seem like a big deal at first. Then he started distancing himself from our group of friends. It was only a matter of time before he became completely addicted.  The pills become too expensive. If you can't afford them anymore you steal money from anyone or anywhere.  Once you can't afford that anymore, you switch to a cheaper option.  Heroin.  He has overdosed 2 times now.  Luckily he has survived.  Been to prison, rehab, and almost death, however nothing has saved him or made him stop.  I do not know my best friend anymore, I dont know where he lives anymore.  I occasionally hear about him, someone tells me they ran into him from time to time.  Last I heard he moved out of state to Pennsylvania.  I worry everyday that the next news I'm going to hear is he is dead.  I pray for him every night. ",box,,Friend,Friend,friend.svg,,
Friend,25,Female,Morris County,Morris,"My best friend of 10+ years met a guy and he has gotten her addicted to heroin. She got clean for a little bit and left him but then something made her go back to him. She has started using again and does not talk to anyone, including family. Every day we fear she will wind up dead either from the heroin or from her abusive boyfriend. Her family and I stay in contact and constantly worry about her. She has become a totally different person. She is frail and looks so sick all of the time.

Michael,30,Male,Manville,Somerset,"At first it was a total friend... Calming storms that brewed in me for years... I lost my mother to this disease and a really special friend... I was in every stage of great at any moment due to a psychological disorder I had and I thought heroin was the answer... I didn't know or was to blind to see what destruction it would cause to my body, mind, and spirit... I tried countless times to stop with the same result being picking back up. December 2 2013 I thought I've had enough doing an extreme amount of dope I knew would end up killing me. I laid 10 hours on my basement floor! I died twice on the way to the hospital. They finally got me stable yet my lungs could not breath on their own and I was in a coma... Last second after being told to expect the worst from Doctors to my family God interveined and gave me a second chance... A medical miracle dr's say when I could have faced a life confined to a hospital bead or worse... I am one of the ones who were spared... ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Brian ,27,Male,Rockaway,Morris,"My best friend since freshman year of high school began using heroin two years after we graduated. When we were younger we where inseparable. As he began to use harder drugs we began to become more distant. As I began to peruse a Law Enforcement career, I had made the choice to not associate with him much anymore. After he was arrested a few time he began to wise up, and reached out to me. We began to patch our relationship up as he began to seem dedicated to living the sober life after some time in rehab and jail. There would be times were we would be out and he would have no money, then all of a sudden have money at the end of the day from stealing from peoples wallets they left around in the locker rooms of hockey rinks and pay me back for gas and food. Once I realized what he was doing, I had to distant myself again as I didn't want to put myself around the crimes he was committing. I lived everyday of my life waiting for the call or to read in the paper that he was dead from an overdose. We had friends from highschool overdosing and dieing and I had it embedded in my mind that he would be next. That feeling that I might never of seen my best friend alive again gave me nightmares and broke my heart.  He eventually overdosed and needed a ""Narcan""shot to be bought back to life. After he reached out to me again, he finally realized how his actions were effecting his friends and family. Now we are pretty good friends again, not back to were we used to be, but close. I try to be a more positive influence on his life. I feel that if I can make time for him to go out and do sober things with myself, it will help keep him out of trouble, and it seems to be working as he just hit 1 year clean. He eventually became my inspiration and motivation to be a law enforcement officer because I would like to stop youth from making the same mistakes he made as a youth.

Jack,59,Male,Colts Neck,Monmouth,"Heroin and prescription drugs are ruining the lives of many families, My son started with pot, to dealing then using. He went from pot to Oxy's then heroin. Currently he is in methadone program. My hope is to reach parents just getting exposed to this living nightmare. We have done everything to help him, several rehab's and restrictions have little results. They have to be ready. I'm no longer worried about bad guys robbing our home. Its our son who we have given all to who has taken the most from us. Thousands of dollars in legal fees and rehabs. Countless trips to court and probation and the saga continues. We were relieved when he was assigned to drug court in Monmouth Cty, I felt Judge Scully and Adri Lieb's team were tough, But actually cared for the drug users and their families. My son had his first meeting on Christmas eve in drug court a couple of years ago. We thought he would be processed into the program and get the ball rolling to recovery. To my shock he failed the initial drug test and was sent to county jail. It was a long ride home that Christmas eve. He was allowed to stay in the program, But was kicked out after failing again and sent to state prison. I agreed with Judge Scully's decision and support Drug Court 100%. When my son returned he was clean for awhile, Walking his talk, But things slipped back to his old ways of lies and deceit. My suggestion to parents facing this challenge is to not give them a cent. Bring tough love to a level you never thought possible. Parents and Loved ones suffer so much from worrying, You are no longer your kids priority, The next score is. Your addicted kid will bankrupt you if you allow them to. Protect yourself and your family. I strongly feel stricter enforcement should be put in place regarding prescription drugs. Its too easy for them to get. Why would government allow this to continue??? Even the most recent restrictions are not tough enough. Drug addiction is bigger than us. We need help, Our countries future depends on it.",box,,Father,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Logan,18,Male,Red Bank,Monmouth,"I spent about six months addicted to heroin. My older brothers friend sold it to me, talking about it like it was just like drinking a beer, wasn't as bad as everyone says. I successfully quit, calling the dealer in a bout of rage, yelling at him to never sell any to me again. Nobody knew about my problems, only me and the dealer. I'm a quiet type of person and my parents might just be a little gullible and think too much of me, my grades and behavior just as good as ever. I look back and remember only the withdrawals and pain, none of the temporary moments of bliss it had created. I remember the sleepless nights, the heavy weight of fatigue, the constant yawning and the watery eyes. I could go on and explain the more horrid withdrawal details, but I won't. It feels like a mixture of a horrible hangover and the flu; and you have to try to hide it from everyone, continue on with your school and work. I hated life when I didn't have it, and it makes me sad thinking about it. I sometimes think of myself as strong for successfully stopping on my own, but looking back, I think I should have gotten help. I wouldn't suggest anyone going through it alone. 

I guess why I consider my story unique is that I was the most unlikely person to become a drug addict. No one knew about it, because I was worried and aware enough to cover up the empty heroin packages; I mostly had it in my desk drawer, used it, and put it quickly back in the drawer, talking to my parents down stairs like the normal person they'd always known. I had mostly all 'A' grades in high school as well as taking college courses to get ahead. I wasn't a stereotypical user; I wasn't insanely skinny, didn't have tattoos or long hair. I just made a bad choice and continued making the same choice, always aware of the consequences and situation, but never willing to actually do anything about it. Eventually, I did. My whole life had turned into 'according to heroin', an annoying voice telling me what I could or couldn't do because I needed to leave time to get high. Not anymore. Not ever. 

I realize this is a bit long, if you would like to do a full article on me, I would do it; I consider myself a writer and have an even longer, more encompassing nonfiction piece about my heroin abuse, if wanted. If not, feel free to cut my word count down to a paragraph or so. I'll leave my email. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Angela,30,Female,South Toms River,Ocean,"before heroin I experimented with drugs but was never an ""addict"" we just celebrated my daughter, the love.of my lifes, first birthday.

Rob,29,Male,Blairstown,Warren,"I used opiates and heroin for 9 years, it started with prescription pills like vicodan and percocet, then moved on to oxy. As pills became harder to find and more expensive, someone introduced me to heroin. From the first time I tried it I was hooked. I started out sniffing it but eventually turned to injecting. It didn't take long before it controlled every aspect of my life. I was begging for money at stores, stealing, selling things, borrowing money, and selling more heroin to anyone I could to make an extra buck to buy more. The final 3 to 3 1/2 years were the worst.  I was working side jobs to get money, would turn around and spend that on heroin, do as much of it as I could afford and sell the rest to be able to get more. I overdosed one night and ended up getting possession charges. Didn't go to court and kept on using and selling. After 7 month the law finally caught up with me. I went to jail with a 30+ bag a day habit. I spent 45 days in jail before being bailed out. I was on probation and entered into the ARD program which I successfully completed and now been clean for a year and 8 months and hold down a full time job.

Chris,39,Male,Edison,Middlesex,"When i was age 22 i was a full blown heroin addict,like many of my friends. I was pretty much disowned by my whole family and on my own. I maintained a job as long as i could.When my addiction progressed i could no longer work and my only goal everyday was finding a way to get money to purchase heroin to keep from getting physicslly ill. With out getting into to much detail, stealing from family, robbing people,stores or cash registers when no one was looking. This became my daily life and deep inside it sickened me at what i had become. After a few months in county jail and time to think i got myself into a long term inpatient treament facility in Newark NJ.Now coming from where i grew up i was in complete culture shock. Welfare payed for my housing and the food we ate there. I learned how to be a human being again,work ethic and be a moral individual. I completed my rehabilitation moved back to my parents at age 24 and spent everyday attending NA meetings,working and living life sober. Once i got into a routine and kept my self occupied and away from people that used life was so much better then i could have ever imagined.I met my wife within those first two years and got married and had a child by my third year clean.I finally grew up and became the man my parents could be proud of. After alot of hard work i purchased my first home at age 27 and still live there until this day and have been married 11 years now,with three children.

The child that you remember as being so smart and talented, the child that everyone would gravitate to for friendship or leadership, the child that could have made a huge difference in this world.  

These little emerges give you hope.  Hope that someday you will have your child back, hope that someday he will be serious about getting help, hope that this drug has not completely changed him, and hope that you will not have to bury your child.

Annmarie,49,Female,Wayne,Passaic,"My life changed a year ago when to my complete shock I learned that my bright, college going 23 year old was addicted to heroin. Our life has been a rollercoaster of legal cases and battles with insurance to find the right treatment programs. My son has been to the brink of death and now fights every day to stay clean but I had to send him far away to get the kind of treatment that should have been avialble here in NJ. I was so unaware of the availablity of this drug and its impact on so many across our town, county and state. This drug has impacted every aspect of our lives and our childrens lives, but we have a strong resolve to battle this alongside my son. ",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,

James,57,Male,Eatontown,Monmouth,"Our son took oxycontin for a minor back injury and after the subscription was up he started buying opiates on the black market first prescription drugs and then a new girlfriend who was a heroin addict introduced him to heroin. He now is in rehab for the 7th time in 17 months. He has lost jobs, now committed crimes and has done other nasty things to get the heroin.  This revolving door where the insurance companies he has good insurance will only pay for 30 days of rehab is NOT working!  All the rehab places he has been to have said short term treatment does not work. All Governments in the US have to join the California Counties and the City of Chicago's suit against the drug makers that have helped create this epidemic by making them pay for long term treatment of the drug addicts.  Minimums should be 12 months of treatment.  Additionally, instead of jail there are innovative programs that allow the drug user to go work at a facility and they donate their time for treatment, food and lodging and work to let them beat the addiction and then move back into society  at very low cost. Laws need to allow sentencing to these innovative programs if not voluntary. Spending $100K a year to put drug users in jail is useless costly and does not work they get no treatment in jail.  Our family is in crisis our marriage is in shambles and may end over this and our finances are being destroyed with all the costs to get treatment for our son. We are a middle class suburban family that has never had any trouble with the law or drugs and our son is the first to ever use heroin or opiates in our whole family.  Government needs to lead the charge to sue the Oxycontin pushing drug companies to make them pay the billions that this is costing the nation, the crimes that these drug addicts are committing to get their drugs and to stop the many lives being lost to the addiction their drugs have caused.

David,47,Male,Boonton,Morris,"It has affected everyone in my family.  I am married, I have two children, a loving wife, a loving mother, seven supportive brothers and sisters.  I became addicted to pain medication, specifically Oxycotin.  I started out using percocet, then worked my way up to Oxycotin.  Owning a pizzeria, I stole from my business, my partner and friend, to support my expensive habit.  I was taking so many pain pills a day, I am so lucky that I did not die.  Near the end, I was snorting heroin if I was not able to get hold of pain pills.  My life revolved around how I was going to get them, how I was going to pay for them, and when I was going to use them.  I would go through withdrawals and have to wake up at 5am to take a pill, just to be able to sleep.  Thankfully (I can say that now), my supplier, my employee, got arrested.  The police had done an investigation on him, and during that investigation I was on tape buy from him. The police did not want to prosecute the buyers, but instead, called my partner and me in to headquarters and basically had an intervention.  I was exposed but relieved.  My partner, now knowing that I had caused our business woos, wanted nothing to do with me.  

Great news,  I am now clean and sober 2 1/2 years!  I am no longer a partner in that pizzeria.  I went to rehab for 40 days.  My insurance would pay for detox, but after detox, would only pay for out patient rehab.  My wife knowing now how bad I was, knew that I could not come home right away.  She cried to the insurance company, but to no avail.  St Clares hospital found a rehab in Florida that would take the same amount that the insurance company would pay for out patient.  It was the best thing for me. 

I still have my wife, my kids, my family and a few friends.  I lost my partner, my friend.  That hurts the most.  I go to my meetings 4 times a week, and have NOT relapsed.  I am in a much better place now.  I have just bought my own pizzeria/restaurant.  I should be opening in mid October. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,

Brandon,20,Male,West Deptford,Gloucester,"Heroin destroyed me and everything and anyone I came into contact with. I started using heroin when I was 17 years old. I was trying every drug out there and heroin was on my list. I really liked being high. I didn't like myself, and getting high made me a different person...so I thought. And in reality it did. It turned me into a monster. I never thought in a million years id be a junkie. I grew up as a suburban white boy who was handed everything growing up. I had everything I ever wanted...besides the love for myself. Once I tried that dope, it had me. It was over, heroin is the love of my life. And it was for the next 4 years. I dropped out of high school, was in and out of countless amounts of rehabs and detoxes. I moved out of New Jersey thinking New Jersey was my problem. But my problems followed. I moved out to arizona in dec 2012, and in less then a month I had a needle in my arm. I couldn't stop. I didn't want to die, I just needed heroin to live. I couldn't live without heroin in my veins. It's really sad. It destroyed everything I once had. I had no one. Nothing. Homeless. Junkie. Nothing. Junkie. Nothing. No one. Alone. I was completely alone. I then went to my 12th rehab because I couldn't live like that anymore. I couldn't. Since then, I've been clean 7 months next week. And it's something I work at everyday. I work my 12 steps on a daily basis. Im spiritual. Im a changed person. It's so weird. I'd elaborate more but I'm currently in a meeting and on my phone. I'm still sick, alright.

Linda,65,Female,North Brunswick,Middlesex,"My son has been battling drug addiction since he was 14 years old. He is now 43 years old and is incarcerated.  That's where his addiction led him. He is not, nor has he ever been, violent.  His addiction was the reason for stealing and occasionally selling drugs.  Anything to support his habit.  He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in his twenties.  By that time, he had already been selfmedicating.  He never used drugs to ""party"" he used drugs to ""try to feel normal.""  He has been in and out of treatment facilities his entire life.  Successfully completing the programs then released, only to end up back on drugs because he couldn't afford mental health treatment or the drugs he needed to combat the bipolar disorder. It's been a vicious cycle for him.  Clean and sober, my son is the kindest, most gentle man one could know.  He's a joy to be around and extremely caring.  My son on drugs will lie, cheat, steal, manipulate and do whatever else he must in order to support his habit.  This time, it all caught up with him.  He cannot believe he's incarcerated.  He never believed it would happen.  Talk about scared straight; I'm hoping this does it for him.  He recently told me that, ""God is doing for me, what I couldn't do for myself.""  He understands that he is where he is because he never addressed his underlying issues. His mental health issues.  He is seeing a psychiatrist in jail, and is receiving medication that seems to be really helping him.  I pray that when he's released, he will be able to secure some assistance so that he may continue with his counseling AND his medication.  I am retired and cannot afford to help him.  A hell of a position for a mother to be in, regardless of her child's age.

Dominick,19,Male,Andover,Sussex,"I have been battling addiction since I was 15 years old. It started with pot and pills and by the time I was 17, I had snorted my first bag of heroin. It was something I vowed I'd never do. Within 6 months of snorting the drug I began to inject it. My life spiraled and thankfully I have a family who picked up on it and couldn't handle watching me die any longer. They offered treatment and I went. I moved to California afterwards and worked my program to stay sober. It wasn't until after a year sober that I had relapsed and came back to NJ. Now at 19 I'm in early recovery yet again and am living in an oxford house in south jersey. I see how bad it is in our state. What led me into using heroin was how cheap and strong the high was compared to paying for pills. Id said I'd never try this drug, I said I'd never use a needle, or steal from my family. Everything changes when you start using dope. All my morals I was raised on went out the window. I'd like to see more done in NJ to support treatment and change the stigma. While I was in rehab in NJ at least 95% of people where there for heroin or opiates. It's scary.

Tanya,25,Female,Trenton,Mercer,"Opiates have started affecting me about 4 years ago and continue to do so to this day. Unlike most opiate addicts, I actually started taking Suboxone (Buprenorphine and Naloxone) before I tried any other opiates. I knew someone who took it for opiate dependence and used it every now and then to subside my depression/anxiety, which was through the roof at the time. Several months later, I woke up one night in severe pain. My right side was absolutely killing me, and I ended up going to the hospital, to find out that I had a kidney stone. The doctor gave me Percocets. At first I used them as prescribed, but when I realized that taking one at a time wasnt quite making the pain go away completely, I decided to take 2. Twenty minutes later, I puked my guts out because I had no tolerance for them at the time. I remember thinking what a terrible idea that was...until I stopped puking, and realized that I was in a state of euphoria and completely painfree. Needless to say, the rest of those Percocets went rather quickly. When I ran out, I had a cooling off period. Several months later, someone I knew found out they had Stage 4 cervical cancer and probably only a few months left to live. She was getting prescribed Dilaudid and Fentanyl patches. When she did pass, she had a lot of medication left over. When I got to it, it was all gone within a week. Not too long after, someone I knew told me I should try heroin because it was, supposedly, a lot better, and more potent. I was afraid of overdosing because I didnt know how potent exactly it was, so I snorted half a bag at first. I fell in love, and snorted the other half an hour later. I kept snorting it for the next six months, and then decided to try shooting it. In between binges, I started taking Suboxone again on a regular basis because I was afraid of withdrawal. So, several years of that, and a lot of lying, cheating, stealing, and pawning, has gotten me to where I am today. My last relapse was about 3 months ago, Im still stuck on Suboxone and feeling hopeless about ever stopping even though I want to. The littlest things sometimes trigger me to want to get high. I try to avoid going certain places, seeing or hearing certain things...I have to build my entire life around what could possibly trigger me if I want to stay clean. Its the hardest thing ive ever had to go through. Ive hurt so many people including myself, took so many risks along the way, and didnt care about any consequences even though I knew they would happen. I could write a book about it all truthfully...its 4 years of pain, but it feels like a lifetime.",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Eric,27,Male,Oceanport,Monmouth,"From high hopes and a natural love for life to the last, daunting breaths of a despairing life. This could sum up my love affair with drugs and alcohol in a heartbeat. Drugs and alcohol did for me what I could never do for myself. I found a way to feel whole again, but neglected to see where the void came from.

Coming from a loving, but very angst filled family I knew something was off when I was 9 or 10 years old. Something just did not feel right within me; I knew I was doomed long before consuming drink or a drug. I worked hard in school and athletics and usually excelled with little effort. I loved my family, friends, and school with all of my heart. I was introduced to drugs and alcohol early on in high school, but you would have never suspected it to be a problem. I was a joy to be around, a hard worker, and loyal to a fault. Throughout college the using progressed, and with that ran the parallel internal feelings of struggle and despair. I'd say by 19 or 20 I was completely addicted, both physically and mentally, to drugs and alcohol. I graduated college with an excellent degree, but was shortly after in a hold that I could see no return from. I was stealing from everyone and being kicked out of all of my friends' and families' lives.

Before I knew it I was 23 and homeless. I had nowhere to go, and no one to call. I had realized I crossed the line from which there is no return. I plunged into the darkness praying for no return. I did not know any other options.

On January 29, 2011 I was saved strictly through the Grace of God. I had been physically separated from drugs and alcohol and introduced to 12 Step Recovery programs. I saw a glimpse of hope and knew this was my only chance. A gentleman extended his hand out to me and I grabbed it with a strong desparation. I have consistently sought to grow spiritually and enhance the lives of those that still suffer from addiction, and anyone else for that matter. My life today is filled with love, joy, beauty, and most importantly freedom. I am no longer a prisoner to drugs, alcohol, or myself. In the end I only had myself to blame, and today I only have God and others whose lives He has touched as well. ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Dana,26,Female,Hamilton ,Mercer,"I've been on heroin on and off since 2011. I knew I was addicted from the day I started. I didn't graduate to heroin like most people who were on pills first; I hung out with a coworker who did heroin one day .. she offered me some, and I was in love ever since.I went to detox once, inpatient rehab in FL twice, then stayed down in FL in halfway for 9 months. I hated FL; I never want to go back, not even for vacation lol. The longest I stayed clean off of heroin and all drugs was 10 months, 25 days .. I fucked that up because I relapsed up marijuana (my other DOC), and that relapsed progressed .. pot, crack, speed, then heroin. My last run was my shortest, about 4 months, but it was the shittiest .. they always say ""you pick up right where you left off"" and they're right. Although I still smoke pot occasionally, I don't mess with anything else .. well, I'll have a drink or two here in there. But the most important thing is that I've been off heroin for 2 months exactly today, thanks to methadone, which I've been on for a little over 2 months. The reason why so many people keep relapsing, IMO, is because they're completely abstinent, methadone (and suboxone, your choice .. I get mine state funded, so I can only get the meth). More people should taper down slowly.** Also, there's more than just NA/AA. IMO, the 12 step programs won't work for me, but that's also because I have borderline personality disorder and I NEED to tend to it first .. since I've been off heroin, it's big, ugly head is starting to show itself again, and I'm not beat for letting it try to destroy my life again (lost my son and his father due to it). I go to meetings sometimes, but it's myself that keeps my clean, not a meeting or god. MAYBE one day I'll take meetings seriously, get a sponsor, work steps, all that good stuff, but I need to get my BPD wayy under control first. OH! And people should be contacting the DMHAS  just google ""dmhas nj"" and search their website .. call the hotlines, email them .. THEY WILL HELP YOU.

**What I'm doing basically is trying to get my life completely stable before I even try to get off it .. if I got off any time before that, I'd be back in the same place I started, and I don't want that. I'm a 26 year old girl who should have a career, graduated college, have a car, a serious boyfriend, all that happy stuff that I want SO bad .. but right now that's all goals, which I do have. It's one day at a time .. and eventually I'll get there. 

My goals are (not in exact order): Move in to Dunham Hall (permanent SROs .. they're super cheap) once my GA is approved, finally start going to the doctor/dentist/gyno/etc. since I finally have the motivation again (and the insurance) start PHP at Princeton House, apply for SSI and SSDI, continue going to my meth clinic for weekly groups and monthly 1on1, appeal my financial aid so I can go back to MCCC for the Spring 15 semester for Communications, READ MORE BOOKS, PLAY ON MY PHONE LESS, when PHP is halfway done file family court motion to start visitation with my son again (it'll be 4 years in November that I haven't seen him due to my BPD), continue 1on1 therapy with a therapist once Princeton House is completed, transfer to Rutgers and major in Communication and minor in Social Work, MAYBE go for my Masters (unsure of that though, maybeee Social Work, maybe not .. we'll see, it'll be a Rutgers though). Find an awesome job, get off disability, get myself a car .. somewhere in there hopefully I'll finally get joint legal custody of my son again, and maybe find ""the one.

He has been in and out of rehab, just to come home and relapse again.    I am at my wits end, and truly am preparing myself for his incarceration or death.   To date, he is living in a sober living house .    I pray everyday for him as that's the only thing left I can do.    It's a heartbreaking disease, that affects everyone that loves him.

Juan,29,Male,Edison,Middlesex,I've battled it since 2003 in nj. I lost friends and respect of my family. It was opiates I was addicted to. Always worrying. About my next fix and it was horrible. I started doing then due to a car accident where I broke my lower back. It was legally given to me due to the severity of the accident. Worked great for me in the beginning but somewhere along the way I became hooked. Now I battled the addiction until 3012. Once my father passed away and I came back to the states I reevaluated my life. Had no money or job and I felt worthless. In that moment of clarity I quit cold Turkey. It took about a year before the sudden cravings stopped. I was lucky though because I was able to do it on my own. Not many people have the will power to do so. I no longer live in jersey but my family is still there. I finished my bout with addiction in Florida.,box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Mary,56,Female,Pompton Plains,Morris,My son is a recovering adult opiate pills that lead to heroin.  He didn't seak help till he got in legal trouble. Tried a 28 day program with insurance that still cost ud over 6 thousand dollars out of pocket.   Relapsed in 3 weeks 28 days is not enough and if you are in legal trouble you need permission to leave the state . This state has waiting lists. People dieing before they get treatment.  My son got permission to go to a long term christian program in NY state wanted to stay but couldn't because of probation. Thank God for his support network the Church an a group call Heroinkillsnj. I dont know where we would be.  It is sad you have to get arrested to get help and you can't leave the state that cant offer you help.,box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Christina,20,Female,Hillsborough,Somerset,"My mom was a heroin addict and it has forever changed my life in positive and negative ways. Due to her addiction she was unable to take care of my sister and I so we went to live with my grandma. She raised us as her own and I am forever thankful to have such a strong woman in my life who has been an amazing role model and helped me through confusing times while my mom was in and out of rehab. I managed to keep a relationship with my mom even though it was extremely rocky. After years of battling her addiction she became sober and eventually was 12 years clean. What once was a positive outcome, seeing my mom clean and living a functional life after such a hard battle, she eventually gave in. This past month I lost my mom due to a heroin over dose. It was a shock to my whole family and has forever changed my life. I never understood how hard addiction was until she passed away from an over dose. Clean or using this drug has a hold on the person and every day is a constant battle.",box,,Child,Family,family.svg,,
Matt,24,Male,West Caldwell ,Essex,"I'm a suburban success story. My parents sound so proud when friends ask what I've done since college and they can smile and say Matt is a full time chemist making almost $70,000 a year at 24 years old. Compared to many kids I graduated with I'm doing better than most at least on the outside. I know that behind my mom's smile is a dark family secret that tears my parents apart and the worst part is that no matter what they do to help the heroin always seems to win. 

I grew up in an upper middle class family and never wanted for anything. I did everything your told to do, go to high school get good grades go to a good college graduate and get a job. Somewhere along that path I started working casual drug use into the mix and for years I refused to believe I had a problem because look at me ""I just made the deans list i have a 3.7 GPA and I drive an audi. All of my ""friends"" love me but only a select few know what I struggle with. 

I started with painkillers which we thought were harmless because the older kids were taking them here and there and they were cheap if not free because kids would find them in their parents cabinets, bottles untouched for months. I went to college with a small pill habit almost relieved I was starting over in a new place and wouldn't be able to find drugs. I was wrong, I promise I wasn't even looking for them but they found me. 

I sold drugs in college to pay for my habit but the entire time I had myself convinced this is ""normal."" I watched kids get thrown out of school for partying too hard and never making it to class but considered my pill and drug use par for the course. I made it to 95% of my classes, aced tests I was the kid that other kids in the class wanted to study with. 

Soon the money became a major issue, I was spending like crazy and shortly after I was introduced to heroin. It was so cheap in the beginning the switch was a no brainer. For a long time I could days spending very little but slowly I needed more and more. I turned to the needle to reduce my use but addiction escalated faster than ever after that. 

I graduated with a 3.35 GPA and a double major in chemistry and biochemistry. I found a job shortly after and for the past 2 years I've been a full time salaried employee at a great company. None of my coworkers know my demons even though I'm high at work almost every day. 

I've been in programs IOP's and even a stint in inpatient. I have a great job and as much as I know I need help I'm so afraid to take medical leave from work because I'm afraid people will ask questions. 30 day leave? But Matt doesn't have any real medical problems. If they found out I'm afraid my job or at least the trust I've built would be destroyed. 

So i'm caught in a limbo I need treatment but I'm happy with my job. My parents worry everyday but I call them time to time and they must tell themselves I'm doing okay even though deep down they know thats not true. I wish I could turn back time. I remember days when I was happy and didn't need anything extra to help me along. I'm so used to this life now I don't know if I can ever stop. ",box,,User,User,syringe.svg,,

Janice,53,Female,East Windsor,Mercer,"Story is long, now probably four years and 15 rehabs into heroin addiction of my 22 year old son.  Nightmare, would love to share.  So much needs to be done.  I have insurance, but insurance doesn't ever want to pay for long term treatment.  Too many loop holes.  Many rehabs, and they all just want the insurance money.   Kids are young, dying, and never get the emotional treatment, or properly medicated before they move on to relapse, and yet another rehab.  Towns are in denial, kids are afraid of being killed by the dealers.  Trenton supplies our addicts in Hightstown and East Windsor.    ",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Andrea,48,Female,Runnemede,Camden,My daughter has been to rehab 7 times now in the last 4 years. She's had at least 3 friends die already from heroin. They were only in their early 20s. We have to stop these drugs from being sold. ,box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Brett,26,Male,Brick,Ocean,"I was always that kid that said I would never do drugs and now I'm addicted to herion. I ran varsity track and cross country and high school and loved it. Something happen after highschool that change my life forever I tried this small pill called a Roxy that some of my friends were doing and after taking it, I feel in love with it. How can one small pill make you feel so good. It started as an once and a while thing, than a weekend thing, then weekend and Tuesday thing into it became a everyday thing. So I did Roxy's everyday, I went to ocean county college got good grades and worked at a food store. I worked hard for my money and spent it on what I wanted. When I didn't have money I was just sick and delt with the hell. I was raised in a good family, I would never let myself steal from anyone or beat anyone, that's just not me. My addiction was invisible to the normal people around me. As the years went by supple went down and prices went up so I did something I told myself I would never do I tried herion. I started to do herion everyday it was a better high.and cheaper fix. Sometimes I thought about stopping, I even planned it about 100 times but that's the power of addiction. I'm still stuck in this never ending hell today hoping one day I'll have the power to stop before i die",quote,I'm still stuck in this never ending hell today hoping one day I'll have the power to stop before i die,User,User,syringe.svg,,
Lynn,57,Female,Cherry Hill,Camden,"It all started when my son was hit by a car his friend was messing around with. His leg was broke and he ended up in a cast. Doctors gave him percoset. After he recovered, he till wanted the high of the percoset. I later learned from my son that heroin was alot cheaper and easier to get on the streets. That heroin, turned my son into someone we no longer knew. He stole from his grandmother, who he loved dearly and his parents and siblings. He tried the rehab, but it was because everyone convinced him to go. Not by his choice, so it was just a waste of time. He married and had 2 children and was finally straightening out. He got the soboxin and weened himself off with the help of this ""tea"" called Kratom. It helped alot for him. He stayed clean for almost a year, worked, paid off his fines and was 1 week way from going back home to florida with a license. I guess he decided to take that 1 last shot before going back home just for one last ""thrill"".....He never made it. His new address is Heaven",box,,Mother,Parent,parent1.svg,,
Kyle,22,Male,Gloucester City,Camden,"Heroin brought me to my knees. It stripped me of my life. I was hopeless and could see no way out. My life had become all about getting one more. I thought there was no chance of me ever having a life. When I was finally broken enough, I sought help for myself and am now in recovery. There is hope, and we can recover. No matter what we have done in the past, we can live a life free from active addiction.  ",box,,Recovery,Recovery,recovery.svg,,
Kim,28,Female,Gibbstown,Gloucester,"I just thought I would share something I posted on Facebook in September for National Recovery Month:
Hello, my name is Kim. September is National Recovery Month. And in honor of that I'd like to be completely vulnerable and open to sharing my story. All I ask is that u keep an open mind while reading this. Up until about 2 years ago I was one of the many Americans who contributed to the ongoing stigma of addiction. If u were an addict you were a loser, scumbag, evil person, who just chose drugs instead of doing something better with your life. I hated drugs and to this day I still do. I lost a lot of friends do to their choices to due drugs and my choice not to. For awhile I started to feel like the only person in the area who didn't even smoke weed or enjoy drinking that much. I knew nothing about the disease of addiction. I had no clue it was a mental disease and it's not as simple as just putting the substance down. Until my world changed. In July of 2012 I met the sweetest, funniest, most caring guy. He is a hard worker. He has the biggest heart. Would give u the shirt off his back. Little did I know he was hiding a dark secret. He was a heroinaddict. He would become one of the many addicts/alcoholics in my life. Because addiction does not discriminate. It doesn't care how much money u have or how u were raised. It doesn't care how old u are or if your black, white, or purple. It takes the most caring and passionate people and turns them into things they would have never even dreamed themselves of becoming. But God blessed me with this special person. To open my eyes to how I judged so quickly and discriminated. And here I knew NOTHING about the struggle addicts go through.  The love of my life is one of the many people I know who struggles in their recovery. And it's the most heartbreaking thing in the world to watch. These people who I judged with disgust are someone's mom, dad, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, friend, husband, wife, cousin, co worker, daughter or son. And yet I thought I was better then them because I could pick up a drink or drug and my brain didn't tell me it needed that substance to function in everyday life?  Who was I kidding? As I started to educate myself I realized this had effected my life long before meeting my Boyfriend . And that is where I started my journey in changing my life. It's been a roller coaster of emotions. And learning so much about myself and the people I chose to surround myself with and the choices I made in life. I'm just as messed up as the next person. I just don't choose a substance to deal with my problems. But that doesn't make me better then them. We all have issues. I don't think we should throw stones or judge people until we have walked a day in their shoes. I now look at addiction with compassion and it literally breaks my heart to watch people struggle with this disease. And I support anyone who has the courage to recover from this disease. Because I know how much of a struggle it is. I watch it every single day in my daily life. We all know someone who suffers from addiction. And not everyone is willing to speak up about it because of the shame that comes with the stigma of addiction.  Not only is my bf judged for being an addict but I was also judged for staying by his side and I still am judged every single day.  I tell my story to build my own courage of being completely open and honest and also in hopes this changes at least one persons mind.  People do recover!

Lissette,28,Female,Linden,Union,"I have a twin brother who is addicted to heroin. It has been a part of our lives (my family and I) for at least 8 years now, hard to believe that much time has gone by and we're still lucky enough to have him in our lives, even if it's the addicted side of him. We have been through a roller coaster ride from hell since we first became aware that he was using. Since then it's been the same repetitive cycle and jails and institutions missing death by the grace of god on a few occasions because multiple overdoses have occurred right in our own home. There's been lies and deceit, stealing from his own family, fight after fight and tears shed more than one can imagine, yet at the end of the day he is family and we love him just the same but we live with uncertainly day in and day and keep faith in hoping that tomorrow is another day that he awakens and maybe the day that he will become our brother/son/nephew/friend once again, the boy we all grew up loving, the boy who is no longer a boy but a man whom we don't even recognize anymore.
