I met a guy and one thing led to another and I began using with him. First smoking crack then snorting heroin. Then shooting up both heroin and cocaine. This lasted about two years. In those two years my relationship with my boyfriend began to become abusive. I left my home to live with him.  We were homeless for a long period of time.  I've slept in backyards on benches and in the woods. Then the in and out of jail began. For about a Year that's all it was. Until one day I got arrested again and decided to go away to a rehab program called dynamic youth community in upstate new york. I went there for almost 3 years.  Inpatient and outpatient. I eventually started school for substance abuse to earn my CASAC certificate in the state of New York.  Then I began working as an actual counselor in the rehab I was in. I completed my program after three years and then eventually moved back home to NJ. I have been clean off heroin cocaine and crack for almost 10 years. It will be 10 years in September 2014. I am now married own my own home and am expecting a baby any day. I am striving to open up my own rehab center to give back to addicts like myself. It's important to give back and keep things in front of you. I have been through hell in my life while using. Assaults abuse homelessness and almost death. But I honestly wouldn't change any day of it. I wouldn't be the woman I am today if it wasn't for what I've been through. I met people in rehab that taught me how to be any human being again.

And as soon as I tried it I was instantly in love with how it made me feel. In high school I struggled with drinking too much and developed a cocaine addiction and was in my first rehab at 15. I never did pills before picking herion, I honestly didn't like how opiates made me feel. My herion addiction started off only on weekends and I was only sniffing it. On Thanksgiving i woke up extremely sick and thought I had the flu, later that night me and my boyfriend got heroin and all symptoms instantly went away. This is when I knew I had a problem, but it didn't stop me. The next 2 years I used everyday. My family didn't want to be around me and didn't trust me at all. I was living in a motel with my boyfriend and when I turned 21 me and him decided we needed help. I went to my own rehab and he went to his own. Going in I really wanted to stay clean and not use heroin ever again. Shortly after being in a 30 day rehab I was drinking all the time and snorting cocaine and molly. It didn't take long at all for me to start using heroin again. I lost my grandmother and I lost control. The Nevers I said I would never do happened . I was using a needle and using everyday. Then I was shooting heroin and molly everyday all day long. I ended up being caught at work and told I needed help, but I wasn't ready to get help yet. My boyfriend was being sentenced to jail and I was going to get help once he went away. I lived in a crack house with my boyfriend, I never had money for food so I lost a lot of weight. My family knew something was wrong because I never came around. I missed Christmas with my family which killed my mother. My nephew 3rd birthday party in Feb 2014 was where my family saw me after not seeing me for months. I showed up extremely high and extremely late. My twin sister was crushed and I only went there to manipulate her into giving me money. The next 2 weeks were hell, it wasn't fun anymore. My hole family didn't want me in their lives unless I got help. They gave me an intervention where they told me I had a bed in FLorida at a rehab. I said no and went back to my house with my boyfriend and layed there and asked myself what the hell are you doing, this is not the life you want! And i decided to go away. Feb 24th 2014, I went to Florida and I was determined to change my life. 2 weeks past and I wanted to leave because all I could think about was my boyfriend I left behind. I stuck it out and thank god I did because it changed my life, I found out underlying issues to why I was the way I was. Then I went to a halfway house and took every suggestion that was given to me. I am now 5 months clean and extremely greatful. I got a sponsor who I call everyday, I attend a NA meeting everyday and most of all I don't pick up. I never though my life would crumble to the bottom that it did. I hurt the closest people to me and didn't care about anyone. Everything I did was to get that next high. I was a terrible aunt to my two amazing nephews. Today I have my family back in my life who are proud of me. I'm a good daughter, sister, niece, and most of all I'm a better person. I never thought I could be happy, but today I am. My recovery comes before anything else in my life because if it doesn't it will take me back out. I know its not getting better out there and I never want the life I was living. I have my own apartment in FLorida with my best friend who I met in detox. I have an awesome support system down here. Bottom line you don't need to hit a bottom like everyone says, if you want this you can have it.  I still have bad days in recovery, but I don't pick up. I learned that I can have fun clean and aober which I never thought was possible. I'm not gunna preach like this is so easy and you'll be happy immediately because it doesn't work like that. This is the hardest thing I've done, and I still struggle with the thoughts and insanity in my head but I have people in my life to help me through it. As far as my relationship with the boyfriend who I used with and was with for 4 years, he is currently serving time in jail. Today I don't do everything I can to make everyone else happy, I work on me all day long. For new addicts who some advise I have is that if you think that by taking heroin out of the picture and that you can still drink please try it and let me know how it goes. Drinking took me right back out, I didn't do heroin right away but it didn't take long for me to have a needle in my arm like I never stopped. Don't stay with the same people you used with or the places, change is a big part in what keeps me clean. And if you don't think your an addict or you didn't hit your bottom because your not using a needle or you didn't use as much as someone else that's bull because everyones stories are different but we all share a common bond that our lives have became unmanageable, its when your sick and tired of literally being sick and tired. Get a sponsor and work the 12 steps. I promise that it is worth it to stick around because amazing things happen.

We had saved up change for 4 yrs and 1 night noticed that all our change was gone, approx. $1500/$2000. We kicked him out. He denied stealing it, begged to let him move back in. Our answer was no. \nA couple wks later, our business van's window was broken into and rolls of electrical wire taken. Police were called and we saw a video tape of our son, selling our wire to a scrapyard. There is now a warrant out for his arrest. We have not heard from him since that happened. \nHe has stolen his wife's debit card, taken $ from his kids piggy banks, sold the kids video gaming system, his cell phone. He is a liar, a thief, a manipulator, and he is very good at all of these. \nUnless he admits he is a drug addict, we now know there isn't anything we can do. We can only hope he gets the help he needs before he dies of his addiction. \nHe has told us it would be our fault, when your son is dead. We called the police, one time when he texted us this, thinking that he would now get help. The police took him to the hospital, he was evaluated, blood work done. They knew by his blood work that he was using, but did not find any mental illness, and discharged him.

We have taken him to the emergency room, bc we could not wake him up, and when our son tells them he is in pain, they prescribe opiates. ??? Why, why when we tell them he is an addict? Besides our son, I also blame the doctors and the pharmacies. Why is there not a database for opiates. How can our son get 3,4,5 prescriptions in the same week from different doctors and different pharmacies? Damn, I can't even get blood pressure pills without specific authorizations! My BP pills cost 60.00, opiates cost $5.00! Why do doctors still use paper prescription pads? We had 1 bottle of OxyContin with 100 pills prescribed! Did he change the quantity? Or did the Dr prescribe that many? \nThis is all a vicious cycle and until the drug companies, doctors and pharmacies do something, this widespread use of pain killer addiction will continue.

Finding any way to get money so that I don't have to be sick by the afternoon. I've been addicted to heroin for well over 10 years with sobriety periods that ranged from a few months to over a year. I lost everything I was about to lose my family when it clicked that I don't want to be doing this anymore. I want my life back I want to be happy and healthy. I stole from my mom from work something I never thought I would do I did. I lost my job (actually happy about that) but I never lost my family. See in my house all three kids were heroin addicts. We were raised middle class had values were taught to hold the doors for others and all ways say please and thank you. We weren't street kids with parents that didn't care in fact they care to much at times never wanting to see us fall and that can hinder a drug addict. Let us fall let us get to the point were the options are death or jail and most likely you won't go to jail. See in Camden the cops don't go after the dealers they go after the buyers take the drugs and if they want to write you a ticket or take you to jail they will but 9 out of 10 times they just tell you to leave and take your drugs. See i didn't fit the mold of a drug addict so when I was pulled over by them they just let me go and so many times I wanted them to take me away so I could get help. I don't have health insurance so I can't afford to get help unless I am in legal trouble what bullshit is that. Last year my parents paid for my younger brother out of pocket to go to rehab only to get and use again. He is a habitual relapser going to a rehab getting out and using. My older brother his wife gave him an ultimatum get help or we get divorced even though they just got married. He has been clean from opiates for a few years now. My younger brother just went to another detox/ rehab last week. Will it work this time who knows it's his 8th or 9th time going and he is only 24 years old. For me I have been clean again for 3 weeks I left myself with no money no gas and stuck it out until I was able to see a suboxone therapist a week later. In the mean time I was sick as a dog but realized that this was it the last FUCKING TIME I SWEAR TO GOD I AM DONE. I want my family more then I want the drug. The cops in Camden need to grow some fucking balls and go after the dealers instead of the buyers. Ok so you may get 10 bags off of a person but the dealers are holding it in houses they buy on a street they set up for drug operations all ways having thousands of bags in those houses at any time. But no the cops are told not to bother with them in case they are holding guns. See down here the guys setting up the sets aren't getting kids to sell there drugs they are getting drug addicts to sell the drugs in exchange for a few bags and some money. Ok so they put cops on foot patrol in Camden but only on a few streets and doesn't matter people are still selling and now PCP is a big thing for the dealers themselves to use and other black people that live in Camden walk down. Mt. Ephriam Ave. and you will see people all over lighting up a cigarette laced with PCP with a cop standing right there. They rave about all the cops they have out in Camden doing foot patrol and making a difference but that's bull shit they go after the guppy instead of the shark. So drugs will all ways be  in Camden until they grow some balls and do something. My story is the same as everyone else's it started off with prescription drugs and ended with heroin. Will this be my last time ever using it again I don't know but all I can do is live one day at a time appreciate what life has to offer. Life really isn't that bad ok so I used so I didn't have to deal with life and the issues I have dealt with in my life but in the end life is far more better without drugs. So maybe this will be my last time I'm hoping and I pray everyday the urge to use has gone away but it can all ways come back its a life long issue. Now only they offered free help to people like me therapy and suboxon treatment but there is to much money to be made off of it plus most doctors don't go through the insurance companies. The hardest part about being an addict is watching your parents cry every day and night because all they want is to make you better and they can't.

Once her addiction took hold, we saw my sweet, beautiful, sensible, caring and intelligent daughter transform into this completely different person. She became a sickly, disheveled, lying, lazy stranger. She seemed to sleep most days away, slowly losing interest in everything she had previously cared about. She lost her job, quit school and was basically killing herself right in front of our eyes. Our fears and concern for her led to some very ugly family scenes. Our lack of understanding only helped to enable and eventually accelerate her downward spiral. My own life had become insane. My physical and emotional health began to rapidly deteriorate.\n\nThe real  turning point for us was the discovery that she had been systematically stealing from every member of our family including my elderly mom who had come to live with us. These events led to the beginning of her detox and rehab journey as well as my own recovery with the assistance of a local Naranon support group. The next six months were filled with insurance battles, attempts at outpatient (IOP) treatment, creation of healthy boundaries, relapses, a week of homelessness on the streets of NJ, a brief inpatient stay (which insurance would not cover), followed by PHP (partial hospitalization) and more IOP services. Finally, by January of 2013, it became obvious that if my daughter stayed home none of us would ever be well again. \n\nThrough a recommendation she received from a counselor at her last IOP,  she was given the number of an outreach program called Steps to Recovery. With the help of this program she was placed in a rehab facility in Florida. This advocacy group negotiated with our insurance company and gained their reluctant approval. The rehab facility (Ocean Breeze Recovery) agreed to accept whatever our insurance would pay and scholarship the remaining cost of her stay. Over the course of the next year, she continued her battle with addiction having multiple relapses followed by quick returns to sobriety. Her last relapse almost caused her her life after shooting heroin laced with fentanyl. I can honestly say that I could not have survived all of this trauma without the support of my friends at Naranon.\n\nAt this time, my daughter is living in a three quarter sober house, working a fulltime job, and actively participating in a twelve step program with the help of her Sponsor. She recently celebrated six months of sobriety and is working hard to get her entire life back on track realizing that she has a lifelong battle ahead of her. I feel that a new and improved version of my \"real\" daughter has been returned to our family. At this time, I am truly hopeful for her future. However, I continue to attend my weekly support meetings understanding how fragile both of our recoveries are. \n\nWith the help of my Naranon groups, and their literature, I have learned to ��_��_��_detach with love��_�, allowing my daughter to figure out her own life. I realized that all of my \"help\" had really just prolonged her disease and that by getting out of the way I have shown my daughter that I believe in her ability to manage her own life. I can honestly say that I have found serenity and gratitude as a result. My relationship with my addicted daughter is now based on mutual respect and understanding.

He was your typical boy next door.  As a kid he played little league, was in the boy scouts, PopWarner, did recreational basketball and baseball.  He was part of the football team at Colts Neck High School.  He shared his father��_�s love for the Yankees, Giants, and the Knicks.  He was bright with a gift for writing.  \n\nThen one day Nick��_�s love of adventure and curiosity led him in the wrong path.  He tried painkillers while a sophomore in high school.  He thought he could control it; that he was only taking it for fun.  But soon, the pills were controlling him. He had become an addict.  When pills were not enough and got too expensive to maintain, he graduated to heroin and later to heroin mixed with cocaine (speedball).  We did not find out about his painkiller addiction until December 7, 2010, when he broke down and admitted to his father that he had a problem.  That would be the first of 6 stints at drug rehab centers in the space of 3 years.\n\nAfter his last rehab stay, Nick moved to a sober living facility in Trenton, NJ.  This was very different from where he grew up in rural Colts Neck.  He had lost his job, his car and had received a 5year probation for a crime committed to support his heroin habit.  The experience humbled him.  He was getting in touch with his spiritual side and was seeking God.  We all believed he had finally hit bottom and would now start getting up.  He was making a lot of progress.  In hindsight, too much progress in too short a time.  He found a job at a local gym as a membership consultant, where he quickly made sales quota.  He was able to finance a used car and was offered the position of house manager at the new sober living house he was moving to which is owned by the same owner of the house in Trenton.  This was to take place on the first week of February.\n\nAll these responsibilities at once for someone who was only 3 months into recovery was too much for him to handle.  He felt pressured.  According to texts found on his phone, sometime around February 4 or 5 he relapsed.  On February 11 he was evicted from the sober living house for using drugs.  On that day, he asked if he could spend the night at my house.  He did not tell me that he had been evicted or that he had relapsed.  His reason for spending the night was that my house was closer to his job than his new house in Lambertville.  When he came over we discussed his new endeavors and he told me that he had decided not to take the manager��_�s job at the house as he felt it was too much too handle.  Probably the only truth he told that night, ��_��_��_that it was too much to handle.��_�  He kissed me good night, told me he loved me and went to bed.  The next morning my son was dead from an apparent heroin overdose (as of this writing, I have not received a toxicology report��_��__a needle and a baggie were found near his body).  \n\nThat same day of my son��_�s death, I went to the sober living house where he had been staying to get answers.   I wanted to know why I was not informed that my son had been evicted.  Why no one had been called:  not his probation officer, not the man from Christian Life Prison and Recovery Ministry who had paid his first month��_�s rent, nor me.  The answer I received left me flabbergasted.  I was told that my son was a grown man and had made his own decisions.  \n\nI then realized that the system is broken.  These kids are left to fend for themselves and deal with a problem that is beyond their capabilities to handle.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, addiction is ��_��_��_a chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain; they change its structure and how it works. These brain changes can be long lasting and can lead to many harmful, often selfdestructive, behaviors...The chronic nature of the disease means that relapsing to drug abuse is not only possible but also likely.\"  Therefore, how can he then be held to his decision not to go rehab, if his brain is damaged and not capable of making logical, sensical decisions.\n\nNJ needs a Substance Abuse Intervention Law that will allow parents, relatives and/or friends to petition the court for treatment on behalf of the person who is substance abuse impaired.  This law exists in Kentucky, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Massachusetts and is being considered in Indiana. Denial and distorted thinking impedes and addict to make rational decisions. A heroin addict is only a needle away from death.  This disease is a progressive, lifethreatening disease. The best hope of survival for a person who is substance abuse impaired is intervention. \n\nStudies show that involuntary treatment has the same success rate as voluntary treatment. In fact, many recovering addicts who are living a drugfree life today rare doing so thanks to a courtordered treatment they received after having been arrested for a crime while under the influence of a substance. More often than not, drugs and crime go hand in hand since many addicts resort to crime to support their addiction. Courtordered treatment has been proven to be effective regardless of who initiates it.\n\nHad this law been in place in NJ, the sober living house manager where Nick was living would have been compelled to use it on my son and he would be alive today.  Drug addiction is a hard disease to beat, but not an impossible disease to beat.  There are countless of success stories of people who suffer from a substance abuse disorder who are now living a drugfree life.  Many had relapsed numerous times.  For some it only takes one visit to a rehab center.  For others it may take countless visits.  But as long as they are alive, there��_�s always hope that the next time in rehab will be the time they get it.\n", "code": "box", "quote": "", "relationship": "Mother", "category": "Parent", "icon": "parent1.svg", "img": "box.jpg", "mov": ""}, {"name": "Luciann", "age": "33", "gender": "Female", "town": "Madison", "county": "Morris", "text": "I started using marijuana at 14, cocaine at 16, and was a full blown heroin addict when I turned 18.

When I entered my freshman year at highschool I had already dabbled in various drugs, from pot to heroin. By the middle of my highschool career I was living s double life. Playing the role of a student, daughter, friend. Deep down I was seriously conflicted and injecting heroin in secrecy. I became totally removed from all activities school related. All of my \"friends\" were now those that shared our mutual Interest; heroin. Daily trips to areas such as east orange, Newark, Paterson became nothing of the norm. Reality was a white well respected family and parents were my background and I had no other reason than to fuel my addiction. So this lasted throughout highschool , junior year was my first impatient program. From 1619 I had been in 5 inpatient rehabs, two private 3 state facilities. I became even more angry and frustrated and upon my release each time was not ready or could find the desire to stop using as they say. It wasn't until I lost all connections with my family and true friends, being homeless and stealing to support my raving habit. I went to jail and I guess that was the beggining of the end.I was being tried as an adult having  graduated passed my juvinlle convictions. I was facing prison time and multiple felony offense s due to my out of control lifestyle. With the guiding support of my family I was given one final chance to pull it together. My loving father who is also a recovering alcoholic, put up my bail money and I returned to the house I grew up in being away for 2.5 years. Not before I was sentenced my codefendant, who was also my boyfriend and best friend for 5 years agreed to take drug court as his plee. He was staying in a three quarter house in his hometown, in my opinion a terrible place to return. Unless you give it your 110% people places and things are what bring you back. Just before I was sentenced on Feb 8 2008 Louis Petrocco died. He attended drug court earlier that day and had what he called \"a 4 day window \" where he felt he could use on Thursday and attend probation Monday to look clean. He didn't make it and was found Friday morning by a family friend. He was 23 years old. I have lost many people to this terrible disease over the years. It is a vicious and terrible cycle to break. Luckily I am one of the miracles. After his death I remained sober for an entire 4 years. I relocated to California and I'm blessed with a beautiful, restored life. I have not done opiates since 2008, and I know it does not justify because in the program they say \"a drug is a drug is a drug\". However I disagree. I believe heroin and opiates are the worst of them. Physically controlling and slowly killing so many people. I am a California resident and do have a 215 card. I prefer this than my prescription of xanax doctors prescribed for my social anxiety. Either way I am able to say I survived the grief, hell, pain and ultimately life taking abuse of heroin. I thank god and am grateful to be a survivor and Stive on. Yes there are not enough treatment centers in nj. Yes there should be some more awareness thought to the youth about addiction. I hope my expierence can help bring hope or understanding g to the rising epidemic at large.\n \n", "code": "box", "quote": "", "relationship": "Recovery", "category": "Recovery", "icon": "recovery.svg", "img": "box.jpg", "mov": ""}, {"name": "Shari", "age": "32", "gender": "Female", "town": "Newark", "county": "Essex", "text": "My mother has been dope for as long as I remember and I am 32 years old.

I'm 27 years old and I am from Roselle Park NJ. My story begins like a lot of other stories I have heard over the years. I am an avid weight lifter. I have been working out in the gym since I was 13 years old. 3 years ago I suffered an injury while working out. I tore 3/4 of my pectoral muscle off of my shoulder. Being in so much pain, I didn't know what to do. My mother took me to her doctor, which was a pain management doctor. The first day I walked in the door of that doctors office I was prescribed 10mg Percocet to take once a day for pain. The thing is, my addiction didn't really start here at pain management. It started in my mothers bedroom. 6 years ago my mother was involved in a car accident and hurt her neck. She was prescribed 10mg of Percocet twice a day for pain at the time from the same doctor I eventually went to. I really don't know what made me do it, but I found her pill bottle just sitting on her nightstand and I knew what Percocet was but I rarely ever had it. That day is where my addiction started and the fight for my life began. I took 2 10mg Percocets and laid in bed, ironically watching Intervention on A&E. 10 minutes go by and I feel like I'm floating on a cloud. I can't describe how good I felt in words. Oddly enough at that point in time my life didn't spiral out of control. I still held a job and a normal life thinking I am just using this drug recreationally.. What's the harm right? Well after spending time in physical therapy and being prescribed more and more Percocet from pain management a month, at the age of 24 years old I was a full blown opiate addict. I found myself taking up to 300mg of oxycodone a day. I was even hospitalized because I almost overdosed. That was when it hit me. I needed to do something about this and gain control of my life. To be honest I can explain ALOT more about my drug problem and how it has affected my life, but there isn't enough space here for me to even begin typing it.

When I was 22 I discovered the method of injection through my same cousin, and that became my preferred method of ingestion. After I graduated college (Bachelors degree), it all went downhill. For the next 6 months the needle became my closest friend, and my greatest enemy.  It began to spiral out of control when I first ran out of money and became extremely sick. The sickness stuns you initially, because no one tells you the consequences of daily use. I fell into sickness without even knowing what was happening. My bank account was at $0, my credit cards were maxed out, and I began to steal from my job. This lasted a few months until I was caught, and subsequently fired.  I lied to everyone and anyone about what had happened, because no one would have ever suspected the kid who maintained excellent grades, a college graduate with perfect credit, a steady job, and payments on a brand new car would ever be experimenting with drugs and stealing from his job. This journey took me to being arrested and charged with DUI in Paterson, when I pulled to the side of the road because I began to fall asleep behind the wheel. I shutter to think about what would have happened if I fell asleep while I was driving and couldn't park my car in time. I could be facing vehicular manslaughter if I had hit someone. I awoke to an officer at my window because someone had called the police because someone was sleeping in a running vehicle. He conducted a field sobriety test and subsequently charged me with DUI. This didn't even stop me. I began to steal from my family members. Tablets, Ipods, jewelry, it was all fair game. A forged check along with the missing items was enough for my mother to finally make me answer the tough questions. I had to tell her I was addicted, and had no solutions to my problem. I desperately needed help. It was the single worst day of my life.  I was checked into a detox, followed by a rehab stint.  Upon release I continued to use on and off for another 7 months, until I decided enough was enough, and I was either going to Jail or going to die if I didn't stop this dangerous behavior. The one thing that made me stop was the hurt I saw on my mothers face. I could tell she wasn't looking at me like her son anymore, I had become a monster. The near overdosing, almost crashing my car, being charged with DUI, being fired from my job, none of that made me stop. The sheer look of sadness and anguish on my mothers face was what I needed to see, and it has forever kept me away from opiates. I conquered it, and I am currently doing great. I am back to being a productive member of society. I currently work 50 hours a week, haven't missed a day of work or used Heroin in 16 months. I have saved a ton of money and I'm back to practicing excellent financial habits. I also am back to maintaining a healthy lifestyle (diet, gym membership). I am back to being who I was preaddiction, and I couldn't be happier. I want my story to be an inspiration to those out there currently suffering from what I went through, and I want them to know there IS a way out. I've seen how dark and hopeless opiate addiction can be, but I've also seen the rewards of persistence against this disease and how giving it a fighting chance can save one's life. I am forever grateful to my family and friends, who stuck by my side through thick and thin.

I was a single mom raising a daughter on my own both financially and emotionally. Her father was in the picture sometimes however, an alcoholic. Me and my daughter were close since we didn't have much family. In high school she had a few operations and was diagnosed with ovarian cysts she was also becoming rebellious and hanging out with the party crowd. I was a strict and loving but at times it was just hard to handle. She moved in with her dad around 19 and I moved away and that is when my life changed. I found out she had been using opiates for a while and now using heroin. I detoxed the first time alone fighting w her while she told me she was never going to stop using and that she didn't care if she lived or died. After 3 weeks she was my daughter again. That lasted a few months and she was hanging out with a bad crowd and back using. I was in Florida at the time and flew her down, when she got off the plane I was just do happy and relieved to have her with me but could see she just didn't care about herself and she was high, she passed out the whole ride while I wept while driving. She and I did it alone again, she didn't want to go anywhere and had gotten suboxone from a doctor. She got sober and wanted to ho back. I fought it hard but she got the ticket and I couldn't stop her. Once home she got into a relationship w a 41 yr olld controlling alcoholic. I was again depressed and knew she deserved better but could not convince her. A few months passed and she fell off the wagon and once again she came to my house and I begged her to get help and dropped her off at a so called friends house but not convinced I waited outside and she came back out and confirmed she was going to the hotel to shoot up. I held on to her arm with every fiber of my being g and begged and screamed and punched the car but I couldn't change her mind I knew at that moment no matter what I did she was going to do what she needed to get high. I didn't move I watched her walk away as I broke down hysterically crying watching my baby, my beautiful daughter walk away from my love into the arms of the devil. I  was changed as a person, it was finally my break point. She got sober again only to try and leave her controlling boyfriend for him to beat her so bad he broke her nose and put her in the emergency room. Walking into the hospital not knowing what I would find and seeing her all bloody and swollen once agaiin took a piece of me. She met a great guy who I cared for recently but was back to no good and is currently sober and in outpatient treatment and back with the abuser. I'm thankful for every single day I can talk to my daughter and just getting a response from her makes all other things in my life ok.

I was born and raised in a great family in a nice house with everything I could ever dream of.. Then I met a boy.. He was from Washington Twp (Sewell) and was older. I had just started my first job, answering the phones at a pizza place and was 15. I slipped and fell one day, injuring myself and the hospital prescribed me Percocet. I didn't have insurance and couldn't afford to fill it. The boy, just happened to have some.. Little did I know where that was going to lead me. First I just took one orally. Then one day, weeks later (I had formed a habit and didn't even realize or understand it) there were no more left. The boy came to me with this powder. Told me it was just a crushed Percocet and that it did the same thing and wouldn't hurt me. He insisted it was safe and reminded me over and over that I was injured and needed it. That was the first day of the worse chapter in my life. I snorted that powder not knowing that I would end up with a 6 year life threatening addiction to heroin. That day, after I snorted that weird smelling, funny brown powder, I felt insane. I knew almost instantly that it wasn't what he said. I threw up, I cried, but for some reason I liked it. I didn't dare ask him about it, I had previously seen how angry he could get and was afraid. The next day I did it again and again. I lost my job, I dropped out of high school, I moved in with the boy. One day his friend came by when he wasn't home and asked if we needed anything from Camden, since he was already going. I laughed and said \"what the hell could we possibly need from Camden?\" That is when I really realized I was addicted to heroin. The friend laughed as well and said \"your joking right? Don't you do dope with him?\" I informed him that I only took Percocet and that it was for pain and he informed me that I was so dumb and since when did Percocet come in a blue was paper Baggie? I confronted the boy only to be hit with the truth. That I was in fact doing heroin. I packed up and went home to my dad and brother, then the withdraw kicked in. I literally felt like I was going to die. I was hurting I was scared and I was alone. I didn't want to ask my family for help because my pride wouldn't allow me to let them down. I went back to the boy, got a fix, cried some more and realized that I was never going to amount to anything and I gave up on myself. In the years to follow I started using IV. I was in and out of jail, and hospitals due to stealing and overdoses. I died once and my family finally found out was going on. They fought for me, they put me in rehab over and over and it just didn't work. I stole from them, from strangers, from stores and just kept getting deeper and deeper into my addiction. I did things I swore I would never do just to get that next bag. I was held at gunpoint in Camden twice. I got caught at a dope set in Camden by a SWAT team and still that wasn't enough to scare me away. The heroin had a hold of me. I was pale, malnourished, underweight, and depressed. I was mentally, psychically, and sexually abused on a daily basis til one day I decided that I had had enough. One of my trips to rehab I had met someone from NA that lived in Allentown, PA. I called them and begged for help. Another member of NA from nj drove me out there where I detoxed on the woman's couch. It was horrible. I was so so sick I couldn't get up for days. But I had had enough and I wasn't going to give in. I stuck it out and to this day I am still clean. The day I decided to change was April 10th 2007. Seven years. Seven years I have been clean! I thank god every single day for giving me the courage and strength to get clean. Since getting clean I have worked the steps of NA, I have given my story at a podium in front of thousands of people at an NA convention in PA, NJ, and FL. I volunteered at rehabs and I got my life back. Today, I am married with two beautiful little girls and two college degrees. I am one in a million and I am proud. I'm not ashamed to tell people what I have been through because it made me the woman I am today.\n", "code": "box", "quote": "", "relationship": "Recovery", "category": "Recovery", "icon": "recovery.svg", "img": "box.jpg", "mov": ""}, {"name": "Scott", "age": "40", "gender": "Male", "town": "Jersey City", "county": "Hudson", "text": "I am born and raised in Jersey City.

I��_�m from a small town in Jersey and drugs were always accessible. It��_�s not as much a characteristic of my hometown but the status of NJ��_�s heroine and drug epidemic. \nWhen I was 17 someone very close to me passed away from heroine/opiate overdose. My life has never been the same. Perhaps I wasn��_�t prepared to cope with such tragedy and depression but I don��_�t know if anyone is. I��_�m not sure how I went from coping with a loss to abusing drugs myself but it wasn��_�t long before I was trapped by addiction. The very thing that stole a loved one my family was now killing me slowly. I dropped out of college, I isolated myself from my family and friends, I was no longer the smiling child with the world at his hands. I was just another deadbeat drug addict with every excuse in the world��_��__but I couldn��_�t stop. It didn��_�t matter how much I tried or how many times I swore to the high heavens that I would be clean and sober��_��__I could not get clean. There was nothing more I wanted than to be clean and a productive member of society. I thought I was doomed to overdose or find myself behind bars. I was drowning in a pool of my own misery with my family reaching their hands out to grab me but I couldn��_�t find the strength to grab back. \n        If there��_�s one thing I want readers with kids to take away from this is to never give up. Please, don��_�t give up on your kids if they��_�re trapped in addiction. They don��_�t want what they have. Despite all my wrongdoing my family was there for me whenever I needed them��_��__.even when I was just a dead beat drug addict. My family and girlfriend never gave up on me even when I couldn��_�t look at myself in the mirror. If it weren��_�t for them, I may not of found the courage to come home after a binge and cry in their arms. I don��_�t know where I finally found the courage��_��__I woke up after a 2 week binge of much I don��_�t remember and ran home as fast as I could. I went to my mom in tears and screamed for help. The next day I was in a rehab facility on my way to recovery��_��__only it wasn��_�t that easy. I would go on to relapse countless times and morphed back into a hopeless statistic of relapse. \n        After several failed attempts and multiple visits to drug rehab institutions something finally clicked. I don��_�t know what it was but I can tell you the support and love from those who never gave up on me was possibly the only life left in me.\n         But a short time ago I lost another loved one to the vice of addiction. My roommate from rehab lost the battle and died from a heroine overdose. He was a special soul who helped me get clean. See, when you��_�re struggling to get clean, as a college kid the hardest part is reentering society. Peerpressure is all around you, you��_�ve forgot how to have fun without substances. I found strength and support in this friend; we were in this together. When I was informed of his passing, I was overwhelmed with pain immediately breaking down. A part of me died that day.\nI understand the stigma with those struggling from addiction. There was a time when I shared the same ideology. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion but this isn��_�t a problem that��_�s going away. We have countless neighbors, friends, and family members struggling in New Jersey. I��_�m not suggesting we throw money at the problem��_��__.I don��_�t know what the answer is, I would be foolish to claim I did. Addressing the heroine and addiction epidemic has no clear answers but its perception is clogged with misconceptions and ignorance. \nHeroine and pills ripped my life apart and stole people from my life and I commemorated their lives with my own path of destruction and addiction. But if it were not for the loved ones and strangers that stood by my side I wouldn��_�t be here today. And today I��_�m a collegegraduate with a fulltime job and I successfully ran for public office. I��_�ve been terrified and ashamed to share my story until I came across this project the StarLedger is putting together.

I grew up in a town that didn't have much to do and my mother growing up was an alcoholic. I learned at a young age how to escape reality. My older sister growing up was always the prettier one and I used to get called ugly for a good part of my life and when your young that really really hurts. I never had boy friends and I thought there was something wrong with me. I started cutting myself at the age of  12   k I say that was my first drug. Then a year later I started smoking weed and drinking.  It made me feel cool and that know one could hurt me and that was my biggest fear was being hurt, not physically but mentally.  After awhile I just became depressed and I started day dreaming about killing myself and writing suicide letters and I would save them just in case it got that bad. So that one day came after years of experimenting with with other drugs trying to find that miracle drug that would numb every feeling of fear and insecurity in me. I never thought in a million years it would be \"herion\". I always knew in the back of my mind if I could get it I would try it. My so called friend who was an older boy brought me to Paterson N.J. to get some coke one night and asked me if I wanted to try \"what he does\". I didn't even ask what it was I didn't care what it was, anything that would help me come down from the coke sounded good to me. From then on when we would go it was no more coke it was \" what he did\". It was like we couldn't say the word cause it was a horrible dirty word at least I knew it was a bad word. In the beginning I was on the top of the world and that fear and insecurity left me anytime I sniffed a bump. I hid for a long time in till stuff in my house came up missing. I would take anything my so called friend told me was worth any value. I ended up dropping out of school after a friend's suicide. After that my addition took off and it landed me in psych wourds then my first rehab. I felt dope sick for the first time in my life at 17 but I know that now but back then I just thought I felt weird I had no idea what or how I was feeling I just knew I was severely depressed and wanted to die. I got out after 30 long days. From then on it was the same thing the pysc wourds and rehabs were a revolving doors. The longest I could stay clean was 30 days when I was away somewhere. Paterson was so close it was hard not to go back. My depression got to a point where I hung a belt in my back yard and I would get high on herion on just stair at it wishing I had the guts to just get it over with. I put myself in horrible neighborhoods that a skinny white girl doesn't belong I would hang out with people I had no business hanging out with I looked and felt like the walking dead.  I didn't want to get clean cause I knew what I would have to do and that was get away from everything and everyone I know. I thank God I never had to sell my body for drugs but I did sell my soul. When your on herion people are like aren't you scared you might die or not wake up and I would think , duh that's the point happy people don't do herion and people who do have a death wish and for me I would rather die then go through 30 days of not sleeping and feeling everything and I mean everything. Water would hurt you when your sick. I was dope sick one day and just sick in general of getting kick out of my house taking showers in diner bathrooms and shooting up in some grimy places that I said to myself if there is a god that is the only thing that is gonna keep me clean I'm obviously not dieing. I would try to overdose on purpose and I always woke up or I would make the decision when I knew I had enough dope to kill me I would end up getting crappie dope. So I knew something was looking after me. Finally   after so much going to hell Aka Paterson and back I got an opportunity to go out to La to a free program called the Dream Center. It was a Christian year long program but I didn't care I knew I needed at least a year after all the damage I did to myself. It was a tough program but that was what I needed and it was an answered prayer cause I once said to my ex bf that I wish there was a place that I could get off drugs learn about the Bible and get a relationship with God and that program was exactly that in a nut shell. I ended up staying for 2 and a half years and became the women's House Supervisor.  I loved it I was able to help girls who came in the program who had the same problems I did and I was able to share my experiences of fear and insecurity with them and share that I came in the program kicking herion not knowing God and having no hope what so ever. I needed to help others in order to stay clean. I came home in 2012 and fell back a little and blamed it on N.J. and Paterson but what I needed to learn that it was neither it was me. It wasn't easy and it still can be a struggle if I make it but it can also be a blessing cause I get to help others and there are a lot of others who are addicted to herion. Back when I was 17 the word herion was foreign but now saying it is like nothing cause you hear about it all the time now in the news papers and out of people's mouths about themselves or there loved ones. IV been clean for sometime now. I made it about mind over matter sone people need programs and meetings I just need loving people in my life and the thought of how much I wanted to die on it and it helps. I'm pregnant now and have a new reason to live and going to have a baby in my life that will love me for me matter what I look like.

A year went by with doing well, living a normal life until I noticed a big difference in our relationship. I would work late nights as a server and come home to a man passed out, figuring he was just sleeping every night. One night on my way home from work I called him a thousand of times and got no answer, so naturally I rushed home! When I got home I yelled his name...received no answer. I ran into my bedroom to find him with a sandwich half eaten hanging out of his mouth. Something told me to pull his sleeves up because he was wearing a sweatshirt, and of course I found track marks. I couldn't wake him at first until I slapped him in the face, which then woke him. The next day his family and I pushed for him to go to a rehab, which happened...but only for a couple of days. And this led to two more rehabs after that as well, that only lasted no more than a week. Finally, his family and I called the police after finding him almost gone again and they admitted him to the Salem Memorial Hospital. Salem then admitted him to a facility that he could not sign himself out of without going to jail. Unfortunately, they didn't keep him long and when he got him he didn't stay clean for long. This was leading me to depression and loss of hope! My money was going missing and my family was falling apart, so I decided to pick up and move. The move was great the first two weeks, which we moved to PA. However, two weeks in...he relapsed! This time dangering my children.  Now he's looking to face 3 years in prison and losing his family for good. I never imagined ever having to go though this or having to pray for somebody's life everyday of my own. I hate addiction and what it's done to my love and family. Hopefully one day he won't have to deal with this demon, but for now it's an everyday struggle.

She was prescribed percocet for pain for an extended period of time. When her injury healed and the medecation was stopped she suffered terrible withdrawal. She started getting the pills from family friends that had old or unused pills, when that was no longer available, she turned to purchasing them from the streets. Her tolerance had become so great that she had to take more pills or higher doses just to keep from getting sick and be able to function daily.  When you are addicted to opiates, your body starts to crave them and it's their sole focus. She never told her family or doctor she was suffering because she was a nurse and was embarrassed and a shame, Soon, she was taking 20 pills a day just to not be sick and the cost per pills on the street were 10 dollars a pill. She couldn't afford the pills so she started using heroin which was easy to get and a lot cheaper. When I found out about my daughters addiction she was admitted for treatment she spent less than 1 month at the treatment facility.  She was released and she started seeing an addiction specialist. The doctor prescribed her a drug called suboxone. This drug is supposed to help carve the craving for opiates.  She took this drug for many years and in my opinion although legal, it is just as addicting and you suffer the same or worse withdraws when you want to get off of it. The drug is not covered or wasn't when she was on it by a lot of insurance companies and is very expensive.  While she was taking it, she was not herself and basically was not capable of feeling compassion etc. the drug effects your moods and although it seems to fill the need to use opiates, the three years she took the drug before being free of it were lost years. \n\nMy daughter comes from a supportive family, but what I found out is most people friends/extended family members etc do not have the patience or understanding of drug addiction.  People believe as I did, that people make a choice to take drugs and that they can just stop taking them.  In reality, this is not the case they can't just stop and a lot of people do not have solid support they desperately need to be able to fight the addiction and remain drug free. As in my daughters case, the addict ends up buying or stealing to feed the addiction and eventually finds themselves with criminal charges. Her life was forever altered, now a convicted felon ex drug addict makes finding a new career path very difficult.  My daughter was fortunate in some ways I guess because she was able to get off the drugs and she is rebuilding her life and trying to put it behind her. She still suffers from feeling a shamed and feels that she will always be labeled and will never be able to truly put the nightmare behind her.  She lives with the guilt of what she put her family through and feelings of disappointment.  \n\nMy daughter has been drug free for 8 years now and I am so proud of her and grateful she is starting to have self worth and respect for herself again.

But 2 are/ were very close to me. First, my stepfather. He actually was just released from the hospital from overdosing on pain killers. His heroin addiction was as a teenager that lead to now, pain pill abuse. He has hepatitis from a dirty needle, and now has psorosis of the liver because of the hepatitis. The addiction doesnt just affect the user it affects the whole family. My brothers and sisters thought, this time, their dad was going to die. What hurt me the most was my 22 year old brother telling me, as he drove to the hospital not knowing if his dad was even alive, \"ive prepared myself for this the past 18 years. I know im going to identify my fathers dead body\". Because of his fathers addiction my brother had to play caretaker and man of the house. He was in a sense robbed of his youth because he had to grow up so quickly. He doesnt sympathize with his father anymore. Hes angry. I think the anger comes from disappointment. And I think now, for his own emotional wellbeing, he chose to walk away all together. he sees his father as weak and selfish, maybe not fully understanding the nature of addiction. If there is any positive that comes from this is that my brother knows exactly what he \"doesnt want to be\". He will never touch a drug, and excels at his academics, always pushing himself. He will be graduating college with honors this December. The second person was my boyfriend. We dated on and off for 5yrs. I did not know the nature of his addiction until we were living together. I later learned this had been an ongoing problem since he was merely a teenager. It takes its toll on you emotionally. Someone i loved stole from me for money for drugs. We had our water turned off, cars repossessed, all because the money went to drugs. And yes all that was stressful but the money or material things did not matter. Watching someone i love on the break of killing themselves is what mattered. I nearly had a nervous breakdown. Sleepless nights, because as he did bag after bag, i kept checking to see if he was breathing cuz i couldnt tell if he was nodding or not breathing. Countless emotional arguements for him to go to rehab or i was leaving. Watching him cry that he didnt wanna be this way. Watching him get dope sick and vomit bile and he couldnt move because his body was in so much pain. I always thought how could he love a drug more than me? He saw how it was tearing us apart and he didnt care. Yes, there was jail, etc. i wanted to leave so many times but i always thought he needed me, i had to be there to make sure he didnt die. He had noone else. It just finally got to a point, for my own sanity, i just had to go. I excepted in my mind that yes, he was going to die from this, but i did all i can do. I still hear from him from time to time. And nothing has changed. My heart always stops when i see the number because i fear its a call that he is gone. When you care about someone, i think you always will. But i couldnt let his distructive behavior be my life anymore. And although i have 2 people who i love hurt me through their addictions. I dont hate them. Im not even angry. I had to let go for my own well being. Yes it was through counseling and alot of reading on the subject. I dont think either one of them chose to hurt me or the ppl that love them. I dont think they chose to be addicts either. And how ppl think heroin addicts are scumbags and lowlifes. They are not. At one point my stepdad was very functioning and supported a family of 8. And at one point my ex was very successful, we lived on the water and had nice cars, etc.i dont think they woke up one day and said hey, let me really mess up my life and lose everything to heroin.

Before heroin, I spent years searching for whatever was \"missing\", and at 15 years old I tried heroin for the first time and my life has never been the same since. My addiction progressed quickly. I was smack dab in the middle of the rise of a heroin epidemic. Heroin became my answer for everything. It changed my demeanor in every way possible. The way I acted, the things I spoke, the process of my thoughts. After a short time of using, things started to change. My friends starting dying, going to jail, going to rehab, getting clean. I sat around and wondered where was my rock bottom? I almost felt as though I didn't have one. I've been beaten up, robbed, had my life threatened, abused, kicked out of high school, lost every job I ever had, lost my friends, my family disowned me, I've been arrested, been to jail, rehab after rehab, program after program, overdose after overdose, slept on beaches and in cars, completely homeless. Staying in random places all throughout NJ...bergen county, atlantic county, cape may county, Camden county, Monmouth county, middlesex county, mercer county, but always running back to Ocean county which I find to believe is the worst. Finally, after 4 years of slavery, torture, and pure hell... I moved to Florida. I have been participating in NA meetings, working the 12 step program with a sponsor, and most importantly staying clean...one day at a time.

But maybe, If I had read something like this... if someone could've really reached down inside my pain and told me that things would get better if I simply asked for help or listened when people offered to help me... maybe I wouldn't be where I am today. Everything I have been through has made me a stronger, wiser, and more mature woman. I have learned to challenge my weaknesses, so I can be a better person today than I was yesterday. A better person tomorrow than I was today. But I would never wish upon even a worst enemy, to go through what I did. I pray everyday for every hopeless addict in NJ.

He worked for his habit,lied for his habit and manipulated for his habit. This was just the beginning! \n\n  In 2012 he became an active intravenous user at this point his addiction flew out of control. He began crashing vehicles after he shot up driving taking three trips a day to camden to feed that monster , bills began to fall behind and money was a constant fight. Two christmas in a row i had to borrow money for our children just to have one as he would spend every dime. The emotional and mental deterioration i was going through was enough to send most into the hospital. Rehabs were impossible to come by and noone takes medicaid most are in North Jersey not South except Merryville which is a thirty day program is just not enough for a heroin addict. \n\n2013 and 14 were by far the worst years of my life, my spouse had OD about ten times literally dropping dead in the streets of camden to me finding him blue in our shed at eight months pregnant and performing cpr until paramedics came.  He became addicted to the streets and i kicked him out plenty \"tough love\". He became one of camdens blended in homeless walking the streets and it being ok with him. My kids watched me feed him out our window, my daughter has witnessed him od in our bathroom on my birthday as well as i have knocked down doirs and found him in his own throw up. I stuck by this man for so long rehab after rehab and detox after detox.  Ive watched a respected man turn into a junky who doesnt mind living in a shack off of morgan st where all the addicts go to get high or stay while camden metro are fully aware of this shack they allow it to remain. Ive lost so much cars,tvs,respect, and have nothing because i loved an addict.  Addiction is serious and heroin is the devil, its not just the physical withdraw an addict is scared of but its the mental months long. It was never the physical aspect that he was afraid of he felt un normal not himself not high, being hifh made him enjoy life or so he thought , he was happy he felt good and no matter the times he flat lined he kept going back the drug calls them it haunts them even when doing so good the addict in them calls them. America wasnt ready for the heroin epidemic they didnt prepare themselves for it now we watch as our loved ones kill themselves slowly i should not have had to bury my 26 yr old cousin last year due to heroin overdose nor do i want to bury my childrens father one day.

That was until I dated a heroin addict. \nMy first experience with heroin was dating my girlfriend at the time. I didn't understand it, I didn't get it, never understood how serious it really was. I was so wrapped up in trying to help her get clean, I completely lost myself in her struggle. I put every bit of energy I had into fighting her addiction for her. Nothing that mattered before had the same importance to me, my family, my job, my money, or my safety. I lived this crazy life, far from what I ever imagined for myself for another year until I finally got the strength to end it. \nThe next relationship I was in, only a few months later, was where was I was all over again. Right back at it, feeding another girlfriends addiction. I again gave everything I emotionally and financially had. I couldn't even sleep a full night through without waking to check that she was still breathing. I became so scared of everyone, kept my distance from all my friends and family. I didn't want them to know the truth. I wanted to \"protect\" her image so I spoke nothing of how things really were. \nI was so alone. I had no one. I didn't even have my girlfriend because she was so lost in the drugs she was just an empty shell of a person. I didn't even know her anymore, but yet I couldn't leave her. I was scared of her. I didn't know what she was capable of. It was terrifying. \nI don't know who I was fooling everyone saw what was happening. It's hard to come up with excuses why a grown woman can't keep her eyes open or her head up straight, why she can't even carry a conversation, or make sense when she talks, or why her arms and hands are so swollen and covered in red marks and scabs, or the extreme weight loss or soul less, empty looking eyes. To think back and really believe I had people fooled really makes me see how sick I was too. I didn't even know who I became. \nWhen the money ran out things only got worse. I  couldn't keep up with supporting myself plus her, and her extreme drug habit on top of it all. Things started going missing. I had to hide my things in my own home. Nothing was safe though, there is no safe place living with a heroin addict. When I was out of things to steal and sell, I thought things had to get better. I was wrong, my families things started going missing. Everyone knew! I felt like I was a disappointment to them, how could I let someone so destructive into their homes. How could I put them at risk? I felt so much shame and embarrassment. \nIt was a sad, low point in my life, but when I was finally confronted and forced to face the truth things only got better. I realized I wasn't alone. I had people that loved me. I got myself out of that toxic relationship and really dealt with the damage that was done. \nDating an addict is hard. You can't help who you fall in love with. Deep down, I know she was a great person but she lost her way. She became someone she wasn't. I wish she never took that first pill that led her to what she became, but she did, and I can't change that. Change is possible, but only they can do it. It's a life long journey, that only an addict in recovery can take. \nI feel for anyone that loves an addict. It's not easy loving someone so much, but never feels that love in return. It seems nothing matters to them but the drugs. \nWhat I learned from my experiences of loving a heroin user was to never forget about the love for yourself. Heroin is so strong that it doesn't only effect the person using it, its damage extends way further past the physically and mental for the abuser, it emotionally takes a toll on anyone that loves and cares for that addict. \nAlways remember your value.

She went right back to her old lifestyle and the friends who were in the same rut she was.\n\nShe ended up moving in with a man with a violent criminal record who dealt drugs and all day, they just sat in this dark basement getting high and going to Camden any time they needed to get more drugs. She became more and more distant, shutting herself off from distant family members entirely and calling us, her immediately family, very rarely in brief moments of sobriety. My young children, her nieces and nephew, have seen her only a handful of times but they always ask for their aunt. \n\nSometimes when she would speak with my mom, my mom would be so full of hope. She would call me and talk about how convinced she was that my sister would finally be coming back to us. Then she would see nothing change and her hopes would be dashed and heart broken as she cried to me about how guilty she feels, how she can't sleep at night because she's afraid of what's going to happen.\n\nI tried to keep some semblance of normalcy and gather together sometimes, as a family should, but it always ended in disaster. She would fall asleep at gettogethers and despite trying to rouse her, she wouldn't wake until the festivities were over. Finally, we mandated that she be sober for any gatherings or she would be turned away. Sobriety always meant she would be mean, vicious, and scary. \n\nFor her birthday this year a few months ago, she showed up at my mom's sober and she started screaming at her before she got in the door. Due to many hospitalizations because of her arms becoming infected, her arms were three times the size of normal and covered in scars from having to have infections cut open. Her face was grey and dull, her teeth were worn and brown. You have to understand, my sister used to be stunning. She was a relatively tall, beautiful girl with perfectly symmetrical features. She was a cheerleader and she could have been a model. Her arms are permanently scarred now. If she ever wants a normal smile again, she will need dentures. Hopefully time will heal the sunken appearance her face has taken on but it is no doubt that heroin has caused irreparable damage to my little sister and to our family.\n\nThe man she lives with now believes that he is helping her by buying her drugs so that she no longer has to sell herself to get them. He says that now she gets out of bed only to eat, use bathroom, or get high. Either we will bury her too soon from an overdose like so many before her or she will spend the rest of her life in a bed, wasting her years on a feeling that isn't worth losing everything that ever meant anything to her. There is another possibility, the outcome we're hoping for, that she will come to her senses and seek rehabilitation for the final time and she will change her life for the better. This outcome, though, will be the hardest journey of it all and I'm not sure she can even see clearly enough anymore to know that there are still people who love her and are willing to support her through that journey. All I know is that I would give anything to have my sister back, the one I grew up with, the one I argued with all my life but hoped to become a best friend to when we were grown and living out our lives.

It has been hell for my entire family for the past 10+ years and I still struggle with the trust and the worry every single day.  I believe they are both clean now and they did it on their own, one had to because he was in jail and the other one had no insurance and we had tried getting him help by calling all kind of places asking for help but were turned away.  He was told once that he would get county help but after 5 days of detox they kick him out to say they had no beds for him to get any additional help.  He is the one who really needs it still the most now, I see him struggling the most each day, I believe he has mental issues as well, like depression.  I really think what got them clean is the love of family and the fact that we would not give up on them got them through it.

I don't think putting these kids in jail is the answer, at least for my son he got no help being in there.  No education, no counseling, no rehab at all. We really need education on how bad these drugs are and we need to tell them early in our schools and in our communities.

I got clean because I was spiritually and physically exhausted. My spirit had been shattered, and everything I had known since I was a young child was gone. I had given it away. In my last days using, I was running around Atlantic City with a guy I had met in my previous rehab, doing anything I had to do to get one more taste of that horrifying high.\n\nThe progression of my disease ��_��_��_ because it is a disease ��_��_��_ was a fast one. I didn��_�t see what was coming. I could have easily said I had a problem in my early 20��_�s, but I was the only one who didn��_�t believe it. I was in and out of unhealthy relationships that were based around mind and mood altering substances of some sort, and I was convinced that it was okay. It was okay because this is what people my age did. Just because I didn��_�t go to college back then didn��_�t mean I couldn��_�t party like a college student. Just because I had responsibilities like family and work didn��_�t mean that I couldn��_�t uphold them just because I was hung over or jonesing for one more. \nI didn��_�t start out addicted to opiates. In fact, as deadly as that family of drugs may be, it was really just my last resort. I was a vodka and beer kind of gal for the majority of my using, and eventually that led to the doctor shopping for Xanax. If there was weed around I would smoke it, but I chased the drugs that lowered my inhibitions and seemingly made me feel more confident. But then I found heroin. I found it and I loved it. That young man that I met in my first inpatient treatment center was helping me find pawn shops, selling the beloved rings off of my fingers, which were the last things I had left that were gifted to me from both my mother and my father before my father passed away. We sold a brand new laptop for a mere $80, and he got mad at me one night when I didn��_�t accept a proposition from a 50something year old man to go back to his room for a few $50 chips from the Tropicana. But, I was hooked. I was hooked on the feeling the drugs (including the combination, all of my drugs in my system at once) gave me, and I was hooked on the feeling of having someone to share my hell with, even if he added to my misery. See, he was street smart. I was na��_��_ve and easily intimidated. I supplied the goods to get the money, and he supplied the courage to walk up to a stranger and ask where the good dope was.\n\nIn late February of 2011, I found myself in a hospital. I didn��_�t know where my car was. I didn��_�t know where my clothes were. I had two phones, and I didn��_�t know where those had gone, either. I told the hospital I wanted to kill myself ��_��_��_ not because I really did, but I knew that those were the magic words I needed to say in order to get a warm blanket and a piece of bologna between two pieces of defrosted white bread. I left that hospital and went home to my mother, who was already packing my bags for me and barely had a word to say to me. The last phone call she got from me, all she could hear were the noises of cars passing and honking along a highway ��_��_��_ there was no voice on the other end, and her imagination assured her that her worst fear had come true. She had believed with every piece of her that I was dead. She had the Atlantic City police looking for me, and I don��_�t know who the detective was that was helping her find me, but she speaks of him often and frequently says how she would love to thank him for his efforts and kindness during those terrifying few days.\n\nI finally checked into a wonderful detox center, not because I wanted to, but because I finally understood that it was either continue running on the streets of Atlantic City, die, or stop fighting what was good for me. I decided that maybe detox would be a good temporary fix. Warm meals, cozy beds and protection from the brutal February weather. I told my counselor there that I wanted to go somewhere that was spiritually based. He quickly made a phone call to a treatment center in Florida, and within a day I was on a plane. I figured, if anything, it would be a nice vacation. \n\nAs time went on in that treatment center, I was forced to face the consequences of the decisions that my disease had led me to. I had hurt my mother, and my two older siblings. I��_�m sure when my father was alive it pained him to see me the way that I was, and I��_�m more sure that it pained him to see what I was putting my mother through. When I went to Florida, she had recently been told that her breast cancer was in remission. When my mind cleared, I realized that while she was going through not only chemotherapy and radiation, but the aftermath of the devastation of losing her husband of 32 years, I was putting her through more hell than any of those things combined. All this woman wanted was a break, and she sure as hell deserved one. Me going away was not only the best thing for me, but the best thing for her.\n\nI stayed in Florida for a little under 9 months. I went to a place called Transformations Treatment center, then I went to a halfway house combined with a wonderful outpatient called the Recovery Associates of the Palm Beaches. This treatment plan for me was intense, but it opened my eyes to how amazing life could be. I was having fun, making friends and enjoying my newfound freedom. What people don��_�t understand is that you can lock drug addicts up all you want, you can call them a ��_��_��_menace to society��_� until you��_�re blue in the face, and you can criticize their characthers and their families as much as you want, saying things like ��_��_��_it��_�s such a shame, she had so much potential��_�, but at the end of the day there is nothing more hellish than being trapped in the vicious cycle of drug dependence. I can assure anyone who has not done their homework that it is NOT about willpower. It is not about just putting the drug down and moving on with life. It��_�s not about going through ��_��_��_phases��_� or wondering when that addict will ��_��_��_snap out of it. It��_�s about realizing that addiction in and of itself is a prison. It��_�s torture. It��_�s a disease that I wouldn��_�t wish upon my worst enemy.\n\nFlash forward to over 3 years later. I have stayed clean through working the program of a fellowship of my choice, which is available to any and every addict. I now dedicate my time to doing things to pay it forward and help other people. Also, that girl that thought she was entitled to live like a college kid who wasn��_�t going to college is now in school, maintaining A��_�s and B��_�s. I have a plan for my life today, rather than a plan for the day to get over the hangover and search for some type of drug to get me out of myself. I have a wonderful relationship with my mother, brother and sister. I share a roof with my mother today, but we also share stories, laughter, favorite TV shows. We share a bond that people might have after averting a disaster with one another; which is, in essence, what we did. I have hope for my future today, and I maintain hope for others, as well. Don��_�t get me wrong ��_��_��_ I would not be here today had their not been consequences for my actions.\n\nI wouldn��_�t be here if I had been handed the key to lifelong recovery. Recovery takes work, patience, pain, tears and time. Recovery is a process, but I need to approach it as a daily task rather than a lifelong one. It is such a wonderful feeling to wake up in the morning with a clear mind, able to move my body without the pain of withdrawals, and know that I have a choice today. The disease of addiction no longer confines me to a personal hell. Recovery from the disease of addiction has been affording me the opportunities to do things like drive across the country with friends, choose a major for college, and treasure the people in my life that love me despite my past. Recovering addicts have lived two lives, and are by far the most amazing, inspiring and honest people I have ever known (besides my mother, of course). \n\nI urge anyone who is quick to pass judgment on drug addicts and their families to educate themselves. This isn��_�t just an epidemic, it��_�s also personal devastation. We can look at the newspapers and obituaries all we want, but until ignorance regarding this disease is confronted and corrected, not much is going to change. A few months back, I saw Governor Christie on the news with Jon Bon Jovi at a treatment center that I know of in the North Jersey Area. That was the only time I ever saw our governor publicly address the issue of addiction. Our jails are overcrowded, waiting lists for beds in treatment centers are sometimes stretched out to month or two wait times, and the drugs out there are getting scarier. I grew up in middle class suburbia, as did many of the friends I have who are also in recovery. This is not just an urban problem. The disease of addiction does not, and will never, choose it��_�s victims based on their upbringing or environment. It takes who it wants, when it wants, how it wants. No one needs to die from this disease, and I am living proof that recovery is possible. Although I cannot put my entire story on to paper, I can say that I have hope for others because I, myself, am a miracle. The issue is not who is doing the drugs, the issue is that the resources for help offered to those who need it from professionals are not available enough. We are throwing the addicted into prison for a temporary fix, just to get them off the streets for a little while. They are stuck in there with the same feelings they had when they were using, and are released no better than when they went in. New Jersey needs more beds, less hurdles for those who need help, and more involvement and acceptance from the general population. \n\nThere is no shame in being an addict ��_��_��_ we did NOT choose this disease. But, we can choose to do something about it. I am blessed beyond words to be an Addict in Recovery, but I am one out of millions of recovering addicts. What a shame, though, that recovery is not a word that we are able to use freely without stigma. Those who seek solutions to their problems deserve to hear from people unafraid to speak about their process with recovery. We can be proactive as a community, and we can hold the families up who are watching their children, husbands, wives and siblings slip away from us due to this treacherous disease. I urge those who are too afraid to say that they are in recovery to use their voices to help others. I urge you to break your silence, show the world that you are miraculous, and push forward despite the lack of education among those who are inexperienced and uneducated regarding this disease. We are living, walking proof that there is hope. Recovery is a lifelong process, and perfection is never attained, but we can change lives with our voices. Hopefully, someday, society will follow with their own form of acceptance, and lives can be saved. \n\nOne of my many wishes for this world is for the ignorance surrounding addiction, which is held mostly by those unaffected by it personally, to disappear. For life to be celebrated rather than condemned due to the word ��_��_��_addict��_�. We are not bad people. We are getting better, a day at a time, with the help of other people who are just like us. \n\nSo, society, step up and stop judging. \n", "code": "box", "quote": "", "relationship": "Recovery", "category": "Recovery", "icon": "recovery.svg", "img": "box.jpg", "mov": ""}, {"name": "Loree", "age": "43", "gender": "Female", "town": "Washington", "county": "Warren", "text": "It's been an ongoing battle with are teen aged son,from missing items in are home to constant worry for his life.And we tried rehab but the staff just educates the kids how they have rights and they don't have to stay if they don't want to!!Unreal.So now we are trying the Vivatrol shot because it's are last resort,he will be 18 soon and that alone scares me,I am Praying he is done but I will always be a worried Mom.", "code": "box", "quote": "", "relationship": "Mother", "category": "Parent", "icon": "parent1.svg", "img": "box.jpg", "mov": ""}, {"name": "Carolyn", "age": "26", "gender": "Female", "town": "Hamilton", "county": "Mercer", "text": "Both of my parents were heroin addicts.

I can still remember every minute of his coma from standing by his bed everyday in the hospital doing anything and everything to try to wake him up.  I can remember my mother at the hospital from 6 a.m. in the morning until they would actually ask her to go home and get some rest at night.  I can remember every minute of the night they told us he wasn't going to make it and how all his organs were shutting down and do we know how long he was without oxygen.  I can remember them asking us what he was on and we couldn't even pinpoint because what type of opiate wasn't he on.  I can remember seeing him in the emergency room when they allowed us in, they worked on him and at one moment he opened his eyes and looked at me and then the monitors went off and they threw us out.  Late that night they told us he was in a coma.  They told my mother he would never wake up, but we prayed everyday.  I knew he was still there.  When he woke up it wasn't like the movies or t.v. shows.  It was real.  He didn't speak, instead he squeezed my mother and my hand so tight and manage to squeel f*&* in the strangest manner ever.  He wasn't fully there.  He couldn't walk, he couldn't talk, he couldn't wipe his ass, he couldn't wash, he couldn't even feed himself, he couldn't do anything!  It was a long recovery period that affected us in ways we don't even speak about too often today.  I despise opiates/heroin more than my worst enemy.  I now have a sister who struggles with the same addiction even after everything we have been through.  She had been to countless rehabs only to end up in the same place.  She is selfish and unbearable because that is what heroin and opiates turn her into.  She is killing my mother.  When I say it again I mean it more than anything I DESPISE opiates and heroin!!!  Everytime there is another big drug bust that happens I gleam with happiness.  I can only hope they keep cleaning up and get rid of all the heroin and opiates that circulate our towns and are killing our loved ones.  They need to take more control of doctors and such since a lot of the opiate addiction has begun with that.  There has to be further research to find new pain medications that are nonaddictive and put into use more often.  It makes me sad for everyone and anyone who is affected by what is going on in our communities these days.

Thankfully, at this moment, he has found it in him to stay away from the drug after kicking him out of the house and 3 types of treatments (2 failed). Heroin makes a loving and calm person into a monster. The amount of fights, yelling, and tears that have come about due to the use of this drug is not a life I thought I would live with the person I love. The itch and cravings he gets from this drug causes him to leave the house to get more and more. A couple of weeks ago was his last relapse where I caught him actually dozing off in the car in a parking lot near our house while mixing the drug with water to inject it. It's heart wrenching to see the person I love self destruct and as I've said to him before if he doesn't get fixed I will be forced to part ways because I refuse to raise my daughter in this environment. No matter the love that I have for him there comes a point where I will have to make a choice between my daughter and me or him if he does not find a way to get better. I have stood by his side through all of this and I think he has finally found a method of treatment that personally helps him.

I am a twenty four year old college student, waitress, daughter, big sister, girlfriend and friend.  I have been battling heroin addiction since I sniffed my first bag when I was seventeen years old.  I remember that day like it was yesterday.  My friend and I were driving home from Camden, I put the dollar bill in the wax paper bag and inhaled through my nose.  It was a disgusting smell and an even more awful taste, but my body instantly started tingling everywhere.  It was a warm, comforting sensation all throughout my being.  I knew I had found the answer.  I knew I had found the secret glue that I had been missing my whole life.  I immediately fell completely in love.\n     I threw up profusely the rest of that hot, summer day.  I was sweating and I was so itchy.  It did not matter, nothing mattered anymore because I felt invincible.  I felt at peace for the first time in my whole life.\n     I went to my first rehab when I was eighteen years old because I had experienced my first overdose on July 31, 2008.  I was told that a UPS guy found me on the side of the road, barely dressed and gave me CPR which saved my life according to the doctors.  I went away because that was the first time I felt like I might not be invincible.  I was scared to die.\n     I stayed clean in Narcotics Anonymous for a little bit over a year.  I felt accomplished and wanted to be a normal college kid.  I started drinking again in October 2009.  I was successful until June when I accidentally got pregnant on birth control.  In July, I had an abortion against my better judgement and picked up heroin again shortly afterwards.\n     I stayed high for three years after that.  Seven totaled cars, six documented overdoses, rehabs, halfway houses, geographical changes and nothing made any bit of a difference.  My mom could cry all day long and it did not matter.  It did not matter how many times guys took advantage of me or what happened when I walked around Camden alone at all times of the day and the night.  I still loved heroin more.\n     I have always been a decent writer.  I've kept diaries most of my life and I am currently going to school at RutgersCamden (ironically enough) majoring in English, minoring in Psychology.  When I was high, I started writing in a blog because I felt so hopeless.  I was convinced that I was going to die and that blog would be the only thing I would leave behind.  I was shocked when people started reaching out to me saying that they had read my blog and that they did not get high that day because of what I wrote.  That was not my intention at all.  I have not written in it in awhile, but it is something that I refuse to give up on because it definitely has a special place in my heart. www.inlovewithheroin.blogspot.com\n     On October 6, 2012 I gave up the fight.  I surrendered because I was 22 and my life was pathetic.  I was completely disgusted with myself and refused to look in the mirror.  I was so tired of behaving like a scumbag.  I am not naturally a scumbag.  I felt hope for the first time in years.  I got clean that time through AA.  It worked for about seven months.\n     I stopped trying to stay clean and started living life.  I got caught up in work and I picked up a margarita one night while I was on vacation.  A week later I was back in Camden shooting heroin again.  I stayed high in Camden for three weeks again and decided to change.  It was the first time that I got high and I wasn't satisfied anymore.  I was alone and I knew that if I kept doing it, I would end up back in all of those dark places all over again.  Just for today, I am not willing to go back to those awful places.\n     I have been clean since May 22, 2013.  It is the most time I have ever had.  I go to school in the same neighborhoods that I got high in.  I write for the school newspaper and volunteer at the soup kitchens in Camden to try to make a difference in the same city that almost killed me.  I am currently going through Hep C treatment, I contracted it from using dirty needles.  I will be on the medicine for six months.  I am saving for my own apartment and plan to move out in a few months.  I got my license back.  I've kept a job.  I bought my own truck.  I have my first boyfriend who has yet to stick needles in my arm and who opens car doors for me.  I have real friends.  I rely on Narcotics Anonymous to show me how to live without drugs.\n     My addiction affected everyone around me and my addiction made me exactly who I am today.  I am a beautiful young woman.  I am a type of woman that I used to admire and think that could never be.  I am grateful for my addiction because I am so much wiser and so much more humble because of it. \n\nMy email: brooke_rose@ymail.com\nMy phone number: 856 981 6124\n", "code": "box", "quote": "", "relationship": "Recovery", "category": "Recovery", "icon": "recovery.svg", "img": "box.jpg", "mov": ""}, {"name": "Araya", "age": "57", "gender": "Female", "town": "Plainfield", "county": "Union", "text": "At present I have 18 years clean from alcohol and street drugs, i.e. crack cocaine, heroin, powder cocaine.

Well i hardly fit the stereotypical heroin junkie. But i assure u looks can be deceiving. For the last 2 and a half years iv been living a double life. Nurse/wife/daughter/sister/friend... A cheating/lying/stealing heroin head. Its exhausting. A little history about me. I grew up in ridgewood. Had the all american childhood. My parents gave me everything and more! They are still happily married. I was raised with good morals, church every sunday ect.. I played sports,made varsity as a freshman, did every after school activity imaginable. After high school i went to college and got my RN nursing degree. I was in a sorority had lots of friends. I met my now husband in college, we got married a few years after college. I started working as a nurse right out of school. We live in an extremely nice appartment we both drive high end cars, i literally had everything iv ever wanted at that point in my life. That was 2 and a half years ago. \n      Starting in high school i had experimented with drugs. Smoked weed a handful of times, i hated it. In college i had moved up to some harder drugs like cocaine and mushrooms... This was an occasional weekend thing. Percocets were around and i loved those but again, weekend type of thing.  It wasnt until i was 26 a coworker of mine mentioned she had her hands on a bunch of roxicets which are known on  the street as \"blues\".  It perked my interest so i grabbed a couple. At first it was still a \"weekend\" thing but  it quickly spiraled into every other day to every day. Before u knew it my tolerance was from a quarter of a pill at a time to 3 or 4 pills being snorted at a time. When i wouldnt take them id be \"dopesick\" and i knew i was in trouble but i wasnt stopping it just fueled the  need for more drugs.  When my supply for blues went dry i would hurt. Id be sick irritable id call out of work in search of more pills.  One desperate day someone offered  me heroin. \"No way\"!!! I thought.. Then my shivering sweating nauseous aching body didnt care, it will make me feel better? Ok ill try... This was the begging of the end.  Once i started doing heroin that was it, i was in love. My savings went, i maxed out credit cards on cash advances, i stole from everyone around me.  One thing iv learned about addicts is despite our bad choices we are incredibly smart, im a master manipulator, and best damn liar out there. Great qualities to have right?? My first attempt at getting clean i had confessed i had a problem to my family and they secretly helped me do a cold turkey detox at home, it was 2 weeks of pure hell. I was clean for a few months then quickly spiraled again. I went away to detox a few months later. Well, i went in snorting heroin and came out shooting up the next day. Stints in detoxes and therapy has been my life this last year.  At first i was good at living this double life, i think i just got too tired and the need for heroin trumped everything i had in my life. I lost my nursing job. My husband left me, he cant deal with the lying and stealing or not knowing if he will find me dead. Noone trusts me. I have not a dollar to my name. Heroin has literally taken the life out of me.  I couldnt make plans to do anything i once loved because finding the time to drive down to paterson trying to cop drugs was my second job.  This drug is no joke. My life is completely broken.  Im trying to rebuild the pieces but  its a slow process, and one thing about being an addict is i thrive on instant gratification.  This is a battle i face every day.

I can not think of a sadder day in our families' history.  My stepdaughter, Alyson Amour, under the influence of heroin was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident in Camden County which resulted in the death of a NJDOT worker.  The sage advice \"you have to wait until they hit rock bottom\" was a reality for my wife and our family.  The heroin addiction had presented to us in 2004, and the system failed my stepdaughter.  Despite top notch medical insurance and a loving mother...a mother that never gave up despite numerous challenges, the system, as a whole, failed my daughter.  We encountered \"rehabilitation\" facilities that seemed more interested in insurance company revenue than actual patient rehabilitation.  Our family physician at the time actually stated \"I don't have any patients with drug problems\".  The criminal justice system is filled with incompetence, and we are now experts in dealing with people who actually don't care about inmates.  There is no real rehabilitation programs at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, in fact, with the exception of Camden County Drug Court, the entire system seems flawed and filled with incompetence.  The happy story is Alyson's status today.  From my observation, the sobering fact that she killed a person whom she had never met was the catalyst in her recovery.  She has had to deal with a criminal justice system which does not care about drug userswith very little programming.  The facilities are worse than public housing.  The food/medical care is terrible.  However, she has quit smoking.  She is drug free.  She is maintaining an \"A\" average in college courses offered by Drew University and local community colleges.  She is an active participant in a \"working dog\" program and now has a skill set training dogs.  The most impressive thing she has done is participate in Project PRIDE, which marries at risk high school students with inmates willing to speak about their addiction challenges.  She is really good at delivering her total message, and is trying hard to make a difference.  To say that we are proud of her goes beyond words.\n\nWe are facing a similar challenge now with her brother, although the problem is prescription medications.  The challenges are noteworthy.  There are problems with the \"rehab\" center mentality.  Our willingness to be dominated by the pharmaceutical companies.  The relative ease in which we can obtain heroin/opiates on the street.  The criminal justice system.  The stigma that may follow her as a convicted felon.  The lack of opportunity that is associated with this illness.  Social discrimination as very few people understand the power of addiction, and the problem.

A woman who was learning criminal justice in college soon would learn more hands on by being on the streets of Camden and in the system of almost every correctional system from here to Gloucester to Burlington counties for all different felony charges and misdemeanors.  The child my parents tried to raise to the best of their ability they watched turn into a skeleton and demon of their once sweet child.  I robbed from my family friends, and even strangers, stole everything I could until even they would no longer enable my behavior and sent me out in the world to fend for myself and my drug use.  my parents changed the locks on the door in the dead of winter hoping it would be enough to get me to want to be sober, only to realize days had turned into months as I made a new home running the streets of Camden, and living in hotels from night to night with money I made from shoplifting and selling it to different places for money.  My parents had spent many restless nights waiting for the call that their daughters body had been found in a ditch somewhere, and I was too selfish to even check in with them to let them know I was alive.  Heroin and cocaine were my only fuel and drive, I lost a job as a manager at a huge swimming pool corporation I worked at, and  I was no longer able to hold down a job for more then a month or two, either from no call no shows, or stealing from the registers and anything else I could get my hands on. I managed to try a few short term programs to get clean along the way, methadone detox which i realized mixing heroin with it, only made it more potent.  After 30 days of the program i had a bigger habit then when i started detox.  I tried take home buprenorphine shots, they would work for 2 weeks tops and again i was back in Camden.  What i came to realize is i wasn't just addicted to the drug, it was the high, it was the life, it was the ritual of using every single day.  My using consumed my life and was a full time job, i would get up at 10am and run around making money and buying and using drugs until 11pm at night only to wake up and do it all over again.  Going weeks without a shower, wearing dirty clothes, unable to rememeber the last time you saved a dollar for a burger off the dollar menu and having people staring at you in disgust.  The worse part is when you are using, you cannot see the collateral damage you have caused to your body, track marks on you hands and arms so bad you have to wear long sleeves.  Or black eyes because you almost got robbed in a dark ally at 1am in north Camden, by someone pretending to sell drugs, or getting a gun pushed to the back of your head because someone tried to car jack you in east Camden.  This all becomes the calamity of your life when you are using, and everyday is really a miracle to make it to see another day.  In a matter of three years I found myself on probation after catching 13 felony charges for credit card theft and fraud, a stolen car charge, and over 20 municipal charges.  Probation sentenced me to two years on their program, and still I continued to use and give dirty urines, I was continuing to shoplift, and it became so bad that I was literally spending more time in jail then I did outside of jail. After 22 dirty urines and 16 new charges, probation didn't recommend me to a program, they didn't recommend me to a rehab, they told me they were violating my probation in two months and a judge would decide if I could be reinstated or if I was going to do an alternate sentence.  I showed back up at my parents house trying to get clean for even a day because I couldn't imagine going back behind bars after doing 180 days only one month prior.  I begged my parents to send me to rehab, but here is the problem, i had no insurance, and i had burned bridges with my parents and stole so much money no one was willing to put faith i would stay anywhere they would put me for treatment.  the cheapest rehab cost 35k with half of the money needed up front, and no one had that kind of money.  I managed to convince my parents my using was cheaper then rehab, and it was no longer to get high, it was simply so i wasn't sick.  I was a half functioning skeleton just trying to get thru one day at a time by not wanting to kill myself from the withdrawal again begging my parents for just one more day under their roof and ten more dollars to go get better. i was arrested again and my violation of probation ensued, they offered me prison, and they offered me drug court because of how many charges i had caught in such a short period of time.  I took the drug court, and they released me back on the streets, i deceived the system again, squeezing in one last hoorah of binge using until finally i was arrested again, this time drug court was sending me away to rehab, since i was never officially given the tools to get clean and sober, nor gave my body the chance to clean up on its own away from the environment i was doing my using in.  i was locked up in jail 4 months before a bed was available at an inpatient rehab, i spent 3 months in inpatient, went to a halfway house for 4 months after that and learned how to live life all over again in a healthy and therapeutic way, learning why a child raised in the suburbs with a silver spoon in her mouth  ended up a full fledged junkie on the streets of Camden.  Drug court saved my life, the officers always believed in me they pushed me when i was ready to give up and go back to a life of a using, and i completed a 5 year program in only a year and a half.  I graduated in 2008 and just celebrated 6 yrs clean in june. im pregnant with my first child and i have a management position at a thriving business, although i wish my life would have went differently, i learned getting sober what it is like to exist in life, and i also have been given the gift to LIVE in this life, and i will not go back to that life at any cost.  I have seen more people in my life in the 6 yrs i have been sober fall into the addiction of opiate pills and heroin.  People like me that never used before, i have lost a lot of people along the way from using and overdosing.  Programs are lacking in NJ at a reasonable cost  heroin and pills have trickled out of the city into the suburbs and affect people from the ages of 12 all the way into adults in their 80's.  People are dying everyday and it has become an epidemic.

I will never forget that morning when my brothers girlfriend called me. I had talked to him the night before and they were supposed to come over and sleep over. That was a Sunday. I worked about 10 hours that day and to be honest, I really didn't want company. I talked to him about 5 times that day and the last time I did talked to him he told me that he was just going to stay home and watch movies with his girlfriend. I went home and make kielbasa and sauerkraut, watched tv and went to bed. I heard my phone ring about 1am and didn't answer it, it was my brother. I then heard my phone ring about 9:30 Monday morning with weird numbers I didn't know, so I didn't answer. About 9:45am I see my brothers girlfriend calling. I answered it and she was crying. I said \"Laurie, what's wrong\" She said \"It's Johnny\" I stopped in absolute fear and asked \"Is he OK?\" and she said no. I said\" I don't know what's your saying, OMG is he OK\" and again she said no. I said I don't believe this, even though I knew what happened without her even telling me outright. I then hung up with her and called my boyfriend and told him about the phone call. He said he would call her and he then called me back 5 minutes later and told me. I screamed, I banged my head against the wall, I punched the wall and broke down and felt this sense of loss that I never felt in my life. I cried, threw up, pooped (sorry), threw up, cried, stared into stared into space. I really don't remember how long I sat on the floor after that. Then I couldn't stand still, I was in a dream and I kept banging every part of my body on the wall to wake myself up. This couldn't be happening. It couldn't be happening. I just spoke to him last night, we had plans on moving down the shore, we had plans, WE HAD PLANS. In my heart I knew why this happened. I then took the Xanax and Vicodin I had for myself and flushed them down the toilet, but not before taking 3 Xanax to calm myself down. I never been through this before but I knew the next thing I had to do was make the phone calls. I called my parents, who knew already because the sheriff was already there. Then I had to call friends. But before I did that I had to go to the liquor store and prepare myself. I called everyone who was on my contact list. It was so surreal that I was living in a fog through all the conversations I had. I threw up again and again and again. I remember I kept punching that wall screaming no. NO! THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING!!!!!!! I couldn't breathe, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I couldn't think. I never felt anything like this in my life and I didn;t know what to do. I drank and drank and drank and yet, I couldn't get drunk. I lined up the beer bottles against my wall to remind myself how much I actually drank. I was dead sober. The loss I felt was unimaginable, intolerable, numbing, surreal, unstable, it emotionally took my life over. I would just walk and stare into space wondering if he had come over, would he still be here? But then I thought, if he did come over and it happened in my house, I would of seen him dead. They would have had to lock me away because I would of went insane. For the next 2 weeks they did an investigation because at first they thought he was murdered. His girlfriend is/was married at the time and is \"connected' He knew of my brother and our family thought that she or he had something to do with it. I demanded an autopsy but my mother didn't. So with this fight going on it took longer then usual for him to be laid out because of the conflict our family having over this. She finally agreed and it was done. Again, in our hearts we know why this happened. Now let's turn back time a little. Me and brother started drinking and using drugs at a young age, It was mostly pot as the drugs of choice and never really tried anything hard, at least that's what I thought anyway. He had lived with me so I seen what he was doing first hand. I didn't know that his addiction was that bad until he started stealing from me and my mother. I still let him live with me because he was my brother and I loved him. I didn't have a choice. He started doing heroin about 2 years before he passed and overdosed 3 times and one time on cocaine. I found him once laying on the couch and I woke him up and screamed at him that I wasn't going to his funeral if he died. He did wake up and composed himself. That's when I knew there was a problem and that's when i started getting scared. There were times when I walked in and the house smelled like vomit. I didn't understand about the vomiting until I started using Oxycontin. He stole the rent, my pay, DVD player and thousands and thousands of dollars from me. The only time my head and mind were at ease is when he went to rehab. he went about 6 times and obviously each time was futile. I knew in my soul that this was the way he would pass away, I knew it. There was nothing I can do. I couldn't help myself, how could I help him? About 7 years ago I started taking pills. It was mostly Xanax, Vicodin, and Percocet. It wasn't until about 3 years ago I started using Oxycotin and Oxycodone. I didn't feel ashamed about it because I didn't think it was the same as doing actual heroin. In actuality, it was. I was doing the \"poor mans heroin\" as people say. My friends and family all knew I was doing it and everyone came down hard on me. I couldn't stop because it was a feeling that I didn't want to end. i stopped paying bills and even stole from my friend a few times to get pills. Was I going to end up like my brother I always thought. But I knew my limit and those couple of times I didn't know, I finally realized why my house smelled like puke when my brother was using. For anyone has done pills or heroin, you know what I am talking about. The withdrawals were absolute murder and even when I didn't want to use, I had to because I needed that feeling to end. it was torturous. I swore that I would never make that phone call and get pills again. I lied to myself because I always did. The last time I took Oxy was about 2 months ago. The only reason why I haven't is because I cannot find them, not because I wanted to stop. I don't want to stop. I do get Percocets and Vicodin once and awhile but it's not the same. Even though I don't do them as much as I used to, I know I'm an addict.His birthday just passed on July 17th, he would of been 40. I knew I had to get something to get past that day.  took about 3 percs and about 5 Xanax, and drank. I was so messed up that I feel asleep while getting a tattoo. Who does that when you are going through all of that pain? For the next couple of days I was on the same path until I couldn't get the pills anymore.  I lost my brother over drugs. I knew it in my heart even before his body was cold. But yet, I continued and continue to use pills.

I was living on my aunts couch and she had found my \"set\" and any heroine addict knows once your needles are gone it's scary.

More than one friend has died as a direct result of using, and several others are still in their battle against addiction as we speak. I, too, am suffering from addiction, and am in withdrawal as I type this. \n\nTo an outsider, 90% of the people I know who deal with opiate addiction do not look like one who would typically be associated with drug use. Middle class, mostly white, good grades growing up, nice kids with good families. These are the kind of people who getting hit the hardest now, as heroin is coming out of the cities and into the suburbs. The problem of drugs in the inner cities has long been ignored by the most of the population in New Jersey, thinking of it as a \"hood\" problem, but now as their kids and friend of their kids are becoming victims in their epidemic, there is a lot more attention. There are a lot of good people wasting their lives getting high, living day to day, and they can't get past the trap by themselves. Once you get into an opiate addiction, days and nights blur together and time passes at the drop of a hat. You don't even realize how quickly the days, weeks, and months pass as you go about your day thinking about being high or getting high. Even before the addiction gets to that point, when a person is just using every week, or every other week, they don't realize what they are getting themselves into. After drinking alcohol or smoking weed, opiates just seem like another way to get a buzz, but before you know it, you're wanting that buzz more and more often, and by the time you realize how bad your addiction has gotten, it's too late and it has taken over your life.\n\nI have been using opiates on and off for almost 6 or 7 years by now. Heroin for about 2. In the early years, I wouldn't think anything of doing some oxycodone on a weekend to chill out and get high. Over the years, I'd want to get pills almost every weekend and get that high again and again. I've also gotten myself clean during those times, and it was never that hard. Maybe a day or 2 of withdrawal symptoms, then an easy week or 2 or 3 of being clean before I decided I wanted to get high again. A couple years after that, after being clean for quite some time, I decided to go looking for oxy again with a friend of mine. An old connection for oxy said he only had access to heroin now, and we decided to do it. Cheaper, and just as strong, if not stronger (quality is never reliable, but cheap prices make it worth the gamble) as oxycodone. Since then, I was doing heroin almost every week, two or three times depending on the money I had, and I never really thought I had too bad of a problem, but with my experience now, I definitely did. Over the past 2 years, I've gone from doing heroin nearly every day, with some clean days interspersed, to getting clean for 45 days and getting over withdrawal symptoms before that voice in the back of my head whispers at me to get high again. It is, and probably always will be, an ongoing struggle.\n\nOne thing I've learned is that there are no happy endings. You will either die, get arrested, or if you do somehow get yourself clean, you will forever be shadowed by the addiction. Recovering addicts are always going to be recovering, for the rest of their lives, and they will always have the stigma attached to them. You can see it just on this site, how some people looking in from the outside see addicts as \"lowlives\" , \"losers\" , and \"scum bags\". It's not just more help from the government that we need to help recovering addicts, it's a shift in the view the public has on addicts that we also need.

It was well worth it.\n    Another scary reality is the social workers Division, and heath care professionals do not recognize this as a problem.

I was on the verge of graduating college from a prestigious school when it all began. If I only knew what doing that first painkiller would transform my life into, maybe I wouldn't have done it. I can't say for sure. But things rapidly progressed. Half a pill became one, one became two, and quickly I was doing ten plus per day. I COULD NOT function without them. I was fired from my job within months. School, which I was credits away from being done with, was not even a possibility anymore. I had lost all hope, my spirit destroyed, and dreams crushed. I was a soulless human being, simply a zombie with the sole purpose of getting one more. And when the little money I had ran out, heroin became the only option. Something I said I would never do. Within months I was shooting it, constantly getting arrested all over the state. Running out of gas on the parkway over and over again. Moving to Newark to live near my dealer sounded like a great idea at times. I did everything I said I would never do, and I did things I never even thought were possible. My brain was hijacked by opiates. A small painkiller habit quickly turned into a heroin and crack habit. My only friends were my drug dealer and my running partner. When I lost my running partner, the person that for a long time fueled me to keep going, I finally gave up. We were a team. And once she was gone I knew I had few choices left: continue going on by myself, risking more arrests, being \"sick\" every single day, or going to rehab. Many people in my town leave for rehab. The sad reality is that most don't stay clean. I told my father I needed help and he said he had been waiting for me to say that for years. I was beaten physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I was ready. I went away for 27 days, in NJ I'd like to add. I didn't have to go to Florida. I came home after 27 days, but not alone, with the Vivitrol shot. The shot gave me an opportunity to build a foundation in which I could start attending meetings and put my life back together. I quickly got a job, making half the money I used to make, and slowly I rebuilt my life. I finally graduated college and am now looking for a job in the field in which I graduated. I have 14 months clean and have a lot of hope today. I have lost four people this year alone that I personally knew to heroin overdose. I am just glad I made it out alive.

My older brothers friend sold it to me, talking about it like it was just like drinking a beer, wasn't as bad as everyone says. I successfully quit, calling the dealer in a bout of rage, yelling at him to never sell any to me again. Nobody knew about my problems, only me and the dealer.

He's working, has made changes in his life and is doing well. Ben lives with his father in Summit; I am in Toms River. He has come a very long way. I am grateful to the staff at Drug Court (Union County) for helping Ben with his recovery.

I was pretty much disowned by my whole family and on my own. I maintained a job as long as i could.When my addiction progressed i could no longer work and my only goal everyday was finding a way to get money to purchase heroin to keep from getting physicslly ill. With out getting into to much detail, stealing from family, robbing people,stores or cash registers when no one was looking. This became my daily life and deep inside it sickened me at what i had become. After a few months in county jail and time to think i got myself into a long term inpatient treament facility in Newark NJ.Now coming from where i grew up i was in complete culture shock. Welfare payed for my housing and the food we ate there. I learned how to be a human being again,work ethic and be a moral individual. I completed my rehabilitation moved back to my parents at age 24 and spent everyday attending NA meetings,working and living life sober. Once i got into a routine and kept my self occupied and away from people that used life was so much better then i could have ever imagined.I met my wife within those first two years and got married and had a child by my third year clean.I finally grew up and became the man my parents could be proud of. After alot of hard work i purchased my first home at age 27 and still live there until this day and have been married 11 years now,with three children. I appreciate everything i have now although i sometimes forget and take things for granted but,so does everyone. As long as i use the tools i learned in the first two years clean i feel i can accomplish anything i set my mind to. I've lost alot of people along the way to this disease of addiction and some i know are still struggling there is hope for anyone as long as they want it bad enough for THEMSELVES. doing it for anyone but yourself is the road to failure right from the start.

Not only was I a heroin user but a crack cocaine user. I ran the streets of Camden just to get high. I lost so many loved ones to this disease and today I will not stand to loose myself. I was arrested in Atlantic City with heroin a couple years ago, and that did not stop me to getting just one more. Today I have 6 months off all mind altering substances.

I remember that day so vividly.\n\n��_��_��_Jess is gone,��_� my dad told me.\n\n��_��_��_Gone? She ran away?��_�\n\n��_��_��_No. She��_�s GONE.��_�\n\nI��_�ve written about you twice. Twice in eight years. Short pieces, never going into much detail.  Most people I have met in my adult life know I have a cousin who passed away when we were just 19yearsold, but they hardly ask ��_��_��_how?��_� and I never tell them.\n\nThe truth of the matter is: how do you explain to someone that a beautiful, educated, funny, wellread, athletic girl with a 10pm curfew was found unresponsive in an apartment with a needle in her arm?  People have a way of pigeonholing those who suffer from addiction as ��_��_��_trash��_� or ��_��_��_junkies��_� or ��_��_��_criminals��_� and that��_�s hardly ever the case.  Addiction is an illness. They had families. They had aspirations. Christ, when you started using you were in honors classes at a competitive high school. One decision, one lapse in judgment, can alter the course of an entire life. I know that��_�s what happened to you, and I have refused to let 18 months out of an entire 19 years on this earth dictate your memory. So why am I writing this now?\n\nJust the other day, your mother said to me: ��_��_��_I thought things were supposed to get easier after eight years.��_�  A lot has happened, Jess.  But you still have a mom and a dad, and they still have a daughter. Your dad has made it his mission to tell your story at high schools, hoping to steer at least one student in another, less fatal, direction. And it seems, more so than when you were alive, Heroin has been pushed to the forefront of the news.  New Jersey is grappling with a spiraling heroin epidemic. Maybe, just maybe, your story will save someone from falling down the same harrowing rabbit hole you did. If not for themselves, for their families. You see, you didn��_�t survive your addiction, but we did ��_��_��_ barely.\n\nI am mad, Jess. I miss you, but sometimes in between the sadness, I am mad. I am mad that I lost you long before you died. I am mad at you for what you put your parents through. I am mad that the last time we hung out together, I never changed out of my bathrobe because I was stubborn.   I am mad that your last words to me were, ��_��_��_See ya later, Cuz.��_� I am mad you never met your beautiful nieces.  I see a lot of you in them. I am mad they play ��_��_��_dress up��_� in your clothes, but have no idea how awesome you were as a person. I am mad you never met the man I am spending my life with.  I am mad that we celebrated your 21st birthday without you.  I am mad that my relationship with my aunt and uncle, your parents, has been strained ever since. None of us talk about it, but I feel it. I am a constant, gnawing reminder of what couldhavebeen for you. Some days I know it hurts, literally hurts, your mother to be around me. And I don��_�t blame her. I am mad the people you used with are still here and you��_�re not.  I am mad that instead of calling your parents that fateful day, you called a stranger you had met in rehab.\n\nDrugs and the inevitable death that will follow kill more than just that person. Pieces of the people they leave behind are buried with them. After seven Christmases without you, your parents finally started putting up a Christmas tree again. Your bedroom is now a homeoffice.  Things I thought I would always recall about you are starting to fade. Jess, don��_�t you see? So much has happened, since everything happened. So much has changed, since everything changed. We were born 11 months apart, but I am nearly 10 years older than you now.  I am experiencing a chapter of my life that I never got to share with you and that kills me.  We didn��_�t have enough time together. You didn��_�t have enough time to get it together.\n\nNo, you didn��_�t survive your addiction, but I know because of you others survived their own addictions. My sister, unfortunately, experienced her own battle with drugs, but your loss motivates her to stay clean.  She is thriving now, and she told me she thanks you. She says you may very well be the sole reason she never experimented with Opiates. If that��_�s true, I have to thank you as well, because I need my sister on this planet.\n\nSo, is this literally everything I have wanted to say to you the last eight years? Probably not. But Jess, I will go on living my life never having the one question I need answered, answered. It was the last thing I asked you when we were sitting on my living room couch that day. ��_��_��_Why do you do this, Jess?��_�\n\nWHY? That is definitely the most asked, and yet least answered question of all time. The question after all of these life choices is always: but why? Unfortunately, there may never be an answer to this question, at least there wasn��_�t in your lifetime. So it remains unexplained, no reason given, just that we are human and nothing more.

Unlike most opiate addicts, I actually started taking Suboxone (Buprenorphine and Naloxone) before I tried any other opiates. I knew someone who took it for opiate dependence and used it every now and then to subside my depression/anxiety, which was through the roof at the time. Several months later, I woke up one night in severe pain. My right side was absolutely killing me, and I ended up going to the hospital, to find out that I had a kidney stone. The doctor gave me Percocets. At first I used them as prescribed, but when I realized that taking one at a time wasnt quite making the pain go away completely, I decided to take 2. Twenty minutes later, I puked my guts out because I had no tolerance for them at the time. I remember thinking what a terrible idea that was...until I stopped puking, and realized that I was in a state of euphoria and completely painfree. Needless to say, the rest of those Percocets went rather quickly. When I ran out, I had a cooling off period. Several months later, someone I knew found out they had Stage 4 cervical cancer and probably only a few months left to live. She was getting prescribed Dilaudid and Fentanyl patches. When she did pass, she had a lot of medication left over. When I got to it, it was all gone within a week. Not too long after, someone I knew told me I should try heroin because it was, supposedly, a lot better, and more potent. I was afraid of overdosing because I didnt know how potent exactly it was, so I snorted half a bag at first. I fell in love, and snorted the other half an hour later. I kept snorting it for the next six months, and then decided to try shooting it. In between binges, I started taking Suboxone again on a regular basis because I was afraid of withdrawal. So, several years of that, and a lot of lying, cheating, stealing, and pawning, has gotten me to where I am today. My last relapse was about 3 months ago, Im still stuck on Suboxone and feeling hopeless about ever stopping even though I want to. The littlest things sometimes trigger me to want to get high. I try to avoid going certain places, seeing or hearing certain things...I have to build my entire life around what could possibly trigger me if I want to stay clean. Its the hardest thing ive ever had to go through.

This could sum up my love affair with drugs and alcohol in a heartbeat. Drugs and alcohol did for me what I could never do for myself. I found a way to feel whole again, but neglected to see where the void came from.\n\nComing from a loving, but very angst filled family I knew something was off when I was 9 or 10 years old. Something just did not feel right within me; I knew I was doomed long before consuming drink or a drug. I worked hard in school and athletics and usually excelled with little effort. I loved my family, friends, and school with all of my heart. I was introduced to drugs and alcohol early on in high school, but you would have never suspected it to be a problem. I was a joy to be around, a hard worker, and loyal to a fault. Throughout college the using progressed, and with that ran the parallel internal feelings of struggle and despair. I'd say by 19 or 20 I was completely addicted, both physically and mentally, to drugs and alcohol. I graduated college with an excellent degree, but was shortly after in a hold that I could see no return from. I was stealing from everyone and being kicked out of all of my friends' and families' lives.\n\nBefore I knew it I was 23 and homeless. I had nowhere to go, and no one to call. I had realized I crossed the line from which there is no return. I plunged into the darkness praying for no return. I did not know any other options.\n\nOn January 29, 2011 I was saved strictly through the Grace of God. I had been physically separated from drugs and alcohol and introduced to 12 Step Recovery programs. I saw a glimpse of hope and knew this was my only chance.

I have consistently sought to grow spiritually and enhance the lives of those that still suffer from addiction, and anyone else for that matter.

I knew I was addicted from the day I started. I didn't graduate to heroin like most people who were on pills first; I hung out with a coworker who did heroin one day .. she offered me some, and I was in love ever since.I went to detox once, inpatient rehab in FL twice, then stayed down in FL in halfway for 9 months. I hated FL; I never want to go back, not even for vacation lol. The longest I stayed clean off of heroin and all drugs was 10 months, 25 days .. I fucked that up because I relapsed up marijuana (my other DOC), and that relapsed progressed .. pot, crack, speed, then heroin. My last run was my shortest, about 4 months, but it was the shittiest .. they always say \"you pick up right where you left off\" and they're right. Although I still smoke pot occasionally, I don't mess with anything else .. well, I'll have a drink or two here in there. But the most important thing is that I've been off heroin for 2 months exactly today, thanks to methadone, which I've been on for a little over 2 months. The reason why so many people keep relapsing, IMO, is because they're completely abstinent, methadone (and suboxone, your choice .. I get mine state funded, so I can only get the meth). More people should taper down slowly.** Also, there's more than just NA/AA. IMO, the 12 step programs won't work for me, but that's also because I have borderline personality disorder and I NEED to tend to it first .. since I've been off heroin, it's big, ugly head is starting to show itself again, and I'm not beat for letting it try to destroy my life again (lost my son and his father due to it). I go to meetings sometimes, but it's myself that keeps my clean, not a meeting or god.

THEY WILL HELP YOU.\n\n**What I'm doing basically is trying to get my life completely stable before I even try to get off it .. if I got off any time before that, I'd be back in the same place I started, and I don't want that.

It's one day at a time .. and eventually I'll get there. \n\nMy goals are (not in exact order): Move in to Dunham Hall (permanent SROs .. they're super cheap) once my GA is approved, finally start going to the doctor/dentist/gyno/etc. since I finally have the motivation again (and the insurance) start PHP at Princeton House, apply for SSI and SSDI, continue going to my meth clinic for weekly groups and monthly 1on1, appeal my financial aid so I can go back to MCCC for the Spring 15 semester for Communications, READ MORE BOOKS, PLAY ON MY PHONE LESS, when PHP is halfway done file family court motion to start visitation with my son again (it'll be 4 years in November that I haven't seen him due to my BPD), continue 1on1 therapy with a therapist once Princeton House is completed, transfer to Rutgers and major in Communication and minor in Social Work, MAYBE go for my Masters (unsure of that though, maybeee Social Work, maybe not .. we'll see, it'll be a Rutgers though). Find an awesome job, get off disability, get myself a car .. somewhere in there hopefully I'll finally get joint legal custody of my son again, and maybe find \"the one. \n\nSorry this was all over the place, not exactly what you guys, etc., but it's something, right?

I know that behind my mom's smile is a dark family secret that tears my parents apart and the worst part is that no matter what they do to help the heroin always seems to win. \n\nI grew up in an upper middle class family and never wanted for anything. I did everything your told to do, go to high school get good grades go to a good college graduate and get a job. Somewhere along that path I started working casual drug use into the mix and for years I refused to believe I had a problem because look at me \"I just made the deans list i have a 3.7 GPA and I drive an audi. All of my \"friends\" love me but only a select few know what I struggle with. \n\nI started with painkillers which we thought were harmless because the older kids were taking them here and there and they were cheap if not free because kids would find them in their parents cabinets, bottles untouched for months. I went to college with a small pill habit almost relieved I was starting over in a new place and wouldn't be able to find drugs. I was wrong, I promise I wasn't even looking for them but they found me. \n\nI sold drugs in college to pay for my habit but the entire time I had myself convinced this is \"normal.\" I watched kids get thrown out of school for partying too hard and never making it to class but considered my pill and drug use par for the course. I made it to 95% of my classes, aced tests I was the kid that other kids in the class wanted to study with. \n\nSoon the money became a major issue, I was spending like crazy and shortly after I was introduced to heroin. It was so cheap in the beginning the switch was a no brainer. For a long time I could days spending very little but slowly I needed more and more. I turned to the needle to reduce my use but addiction escalated faster than ever after that. \n\nI graduated with a 3.35 GPA and a double major in chemistry and biochemistry. I found a job shortly after and for the past 2 years I've been a full time salaried employee at a great company. None of my coworkers know my demons even though I'm high at work almost every day. \n\nI've been in programs IOP's and even a stint in inpatient. I have a great job and as much as I know I need help I'm so afraid to take medical leave from work because I'm afraid people will ask questions. 30 day leave? But Matt doesn't have any real medical problems. If they found out I'm afraid my job or at least the trust I've built would be destroyed. \n\nSo i'm caught in a limbo I need treatment but I'm happy with my job. My parents worry everyday but I call them time to time and they must tell themselves I'm doing okay even though deep down they know thats not true. I wish I could turn back time. I remember days when I was happy and didn't need anything extra to help me along. I'm so used to this life now I don't know if I can ever stop.

How can one small pill make you feel so good. It started as an once and a while thing, than a weekend thing, then weekend and Tuesday thing into it became a everyday thing. So I did Roxy's everyday, I went to ocean county college got good grades and worked at a food store. I worked hard for my money and spent it on what I wanted. When I didn't have money I was just sick and delt with the hell. I was raised in a good family, I would never let myself steal from anyone or beat anyone, that's just not me. My addiction was invisible to the normal people around me. As the years went by supple went down and prices went up so I did something I told myself I would never do I tried herion. I started to do herion everyday it was a better high.and cheaper fix. Sometimes I thought about stopping, I even planned it about 100 times but that's the power of addiction.

He stole from his grandmother, who he loved dearly and his parents and siblings. He tried the rehab, but it was because everyone convinced him to go. Not by his choice, so it was just a waste of time. He married and had 2 children and was finally straightening out. He got the soboxin and weened himself off with the help of this \"tea\" called Kratom. It helped alot for him. He stayed clean for almost a year, worked, paid off his fines and was 1 week way from going back home to florida with a license.

September is National Recovery Month. And in honor of that I'd like to be completely vulnerable and open to sharing my story. All I ask is that u keep an open mind while reading this. Up until about 2 years ago I was one of the many Americans who contributed to the ongoing stigma of addiction. If u were an addict you were a loser, scumbag, evil person, who just chose drugs instead of doing something better with your life. I hated drugs and to this day I still do. I lost a lot of friends do to their choices to due drugs and my choice not to. For awhile I started to feel like the only person in the area who didn't even smoke weed or enjoy drinking that much. I knew nothing about the disease of addiction. I had no clue it was a mental disease and it's not as simple as just putting the substance down. Until my world changed. In July of 2012 I met the sweetest, funniest, most caring guy. He is a hard worker. He has the biggest heart. Would give u the shirt off his back. Little did I know he was hiding a dark secret. He was a heroinaddict. He would become one of the many addicts/alcoholics in my life. Because addiction does not discriminate. It doesn't care how much money u have or how u were raised. It doesn't care how old u are or if your black, white, or purple. It takes the most caring and passionate people and turns them into things they would have never even dreamed themselves of becoming. But God blessed me with this special person. To open my eyes to how I judged so quickly and discriminated. And here I knew NOTHING about the struggle addicts go through.  The love of my life is one of the many people I know who struggles in their recovery. And it's the most heartbreaking thing in the world to watch. These people who I judged with disgust are someone's mom, dad, aunt, uncle, sister, brother, friend, husband, wife, cousin, co worker, daughter or son. And yet I thought I was better then them because I could pick up a drink or drug and my brain didn't tell me it needed that substance to function in everyday life?  Who was I kidding? As I started to educate myself I realized this had effected my life long before meeting my Boyfriend . And that is where I started my journey in changing my life. It's been a roller coaster of emotions. And learning so much about myself and the people I chose to surround myself with and the choices I made in life. I'm just as messed up as the next person. I just don't choose a substance to deal with my problems. But that doesn't make me better then them. We all have issues. I don't think we should throw stones or judge people until we have walked a day in their shoes. I now look at addiction with compassion and it literally breaks my heart to watch people struggle with this disease. And I support anyone who has the courage to recover from this disease. Because I know how much of a struggle it is. I watch it every single day in my daily life. We all know someone who suffers from addiction. And not everyone is willing to speak up about it because of the shame that comes with the stigma of addiction.  Not only is my bf judged for being an addict but I was also judged for staying by his side and I still am judged every single day.  I tell my story to build my own courage of being completely open and honest and also in hopes this changes at least one persons mind.
